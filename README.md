## Quick start

To build the docs locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Run the following commands to check if they're installed:

```plaintext
node --version
yarn --version
```

If Node.js and Yarn are installed, install project dependencies by running:

```plaintext
yarn install
```

To build the docs and start a local server, run:

```plaintext
yarn local
yarn server-docs
```
