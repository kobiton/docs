# Welcome to Kobiton Docs

This repository contains the source files for [docs.kobiton.com](https://docs.kobiton.com/), the docs site for our mobile-testing platform, Kobiton. If you'd like to help improve the docs, you can:

- [Report an issue](https://github.com/kobiton/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=issue&projects=&template=report_an_issue.md&title=)
- [Request a feature](https://github.com/kobiton/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=request_a_feature.md&title=)
- [Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Quick start

To build the docs locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Run the following commands to check if they're installed:

```plaintext
node --version
yarn --version
```

If Node.js and Yarn are installed, you can install project dependencies and build the docs by running:

```plaintext
yarn install
yarn local
```
