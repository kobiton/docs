= VoiceOver in Manual iOS Sessions

== Overview

Test accessibility on iOS devices during a manual session using VoiceOver.

== Prerequisites

Before using VoiceOver in a manual session, ensure the following requirements are met:

* A private iOS device that supports a Bluetooth keyboard
* The iOS device must operate in Lightning mode to support audio output during manual testing sessions.

NOTE: Audio output during VoiceOver testing is supported only on devices configured with Bluetooth keyboard access.

== Using VoiceOver During a Manual Session

When a manual session is active:

* The Screen Reader icon is selectable in the left toolbar
* Selecting the icon opens a floating Screen Reader modal

From the Screen Reader modal, users can:

* Turn VoiceOver mode on or off using the toggle
* Select a gesture or command to perform the corresponding action on the device screen
* Listen to VoiceOver output while navigating and interacting with the device

For a complete list of supported gestures, see xref:screen-reader-gestures.adoc[VoiceOver gestures and commands].

Each gesture or command includes:

* A supporting description explaining its behavior
* A keyboard shortcut displayed in the modal

While VoiceOver mode is enabled:

* Other toolbar tools remain available
* The device screen can still be interacted with normally
* VoiceOver gestures supplement, rather than replace, standard interaction
