:navtitle: Test the app camera

Learn how to test your app's camera using image injection, so you can ensure end-users can take photos with your app.

== Before you start

You'll need to enable *Instrument application for camera injection* when xref:install-an-app.adoc[installing your app] before you can test your in-app camera.

== Add or remove an image

You can add an image to your injection library by opening *Image Injection*, selecting *Set Simulated Image*, and uploading one or more `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files from your computer.

You can remove an image by selecting the *x* icon in the corner of the image.

== Inject an image

Now that you've added an image to your library, launch your app and select the in-app camera. Choose an image from the library and select *Inject* to test your app's camera.
