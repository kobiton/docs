Learn how to test your app's camera using image injection, so you can ensure end-users can take photos with your app.

== Before you start

To add an image to your injection library, select *Image Injection*, *Set Simulated Image*, then choose one or more `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files from your computer.
