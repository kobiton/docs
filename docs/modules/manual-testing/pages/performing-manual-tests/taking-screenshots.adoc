== Taking screenshots

* During a *Manual Test* session, you can click on *Take screenshot* on the toolbar to take a real-time screenshot of the testing device.

=== After a Manual Test session has ended

* After a *Manual Test* session has ended, you can still view the screenshots taken in that session.

1. In the *Sessions* tab of *Kobiton Portal*, select a session to see its details.

2. Because *Take screenshot* counts as an action, click on *Actions Performed* tab.

3. Select the timestamp of the *Take screenshot* action to view the captured screenshot.

4. You can download a screenshot by hovering on it and click on *Download screenshot*.
