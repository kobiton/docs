= Use TalkBack in a Manual Session (Android)

== Overview
:figure-caption!:
Android TalkBack is supported in manual testing sessions.

TalkBack provides audio feedback and keyboard-based navigation. It helps teams identify accessibility issues that may not be detected through visual testing alone.

== Requirements

To use TalkBack, you need:

* Android 12 or later
* A device with Lightning mode enabled

No additional configuration is required.

== Verify Lightning Mode Support

TalkBack is available only on devices that support Lightning mode.

To verify whether a device supports Lightning mode:

. Switch to *List view* in the Device List.
. Open the column selector.
. Enable the *Lightning mode* column.

The Device List allows up to 10 visible columns. If you can’t select the Lightning mode option, disable an existing column and then enable Lightning mode.

Devices that support Lightning mode display a green lightning bolt icon.

== Navigate Using Keyboard Shortcuts

When TalkBack is enabled, you can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate the device.

The Screen Reader modal displays available shortcuts for Android devices.

Shortcuts are active only while TalkBack is enabled.

== Review TalkBack Activity

TalkBack actions are recorded in Session Explorer.

Accessibility events are labeled as `TALKBACK` in the session timeline. This allows you to review navigation behavior alongside screenshots and other test actions.
