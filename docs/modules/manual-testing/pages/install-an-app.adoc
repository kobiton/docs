You can upload a xref:_supported_filetypes[supported file], install from a URL, or choose an app from xref:apps:manage-an-app.adoc[your app library]. If you plan on testing your in-app camera, be sure to enable *Instrument application for camera injection* before you install.

[NOTE]
Depending on your xref:organization:your-organization/create-a-device-cleanup-policy.adoc[cleanup policy], your app may automatically uninstall after the session.
