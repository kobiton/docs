You can upload a xref:apps:supported-filetypes.adoc[supported filetype] from your computer, install an app from a URL, or choose an app from xref:apps:manage-apps.adoc[your app repository]. If you plan on testing your in-app camera, be sure to enable *Instrument application for camera injection* before you install.

[NOTE]
Depending on your xref:organization:teams/create-a-device-cleanup-policy.adoc[cleanup policy], your app may automatically uninstall after the session.
