:navtitle: Use image injection

Learn how to test your app camera using image injection, so you can ensure end-users can take photos or scan QR codes with your app.

== Before you start


Enable image injection for your app with either of these options:

* Either enable *Instrument application for camera injection* when xref:manual-testing:install-an-app.adoc[installing your app] before you test your in-app camera (Android only).
* Or add Kobiton image injection SDK into your Android or iOS apps. Follow xref:apps:image-injection-sdk/add-the-sdk-to-your-android-app.adoc[this guide] for andriod, and xref:apps:image-injection-sdk/add-the-sdk-to-your-ios-app.adoc[this guide] for iOS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not enable *Instrument application for camera injection* when installing an app that already has image injection SDK added.
====

== Add an image to the library

To add an image to your injection library, select *Image Injection*, *Set Simulated Image*, then choose one or more `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files from your computer.

== Inject an image

During a manual testing session, you can use the Kobiton portal to inject images into the camera view of your application. The portal provides the following buttons:

* **Set Simulated Image**: Click the Set Simulated Image button to choose an image file from your computer.
* **Inject Image**: Click the Inject button to inject the selected image into the camera view.
* **Clear Image**: Click the Clear Image button to remove the uploaded images from the portal.
* **Reset Camera**: Click the Reset Camera button to reset the camera view.


To inject an image into your app, launch the app and open the in-app camera. Choose an image from the library, then select *Inject*.

When you're finished, select *Reset Camera* to stop image injection.

== Limitations

* No image size in the image injection control's UI.

== Known issues

The Android application with custom SDK crashes when attempting to start the camera services.

*Cause*: The custom SDK utilizes hidden APIs from Android, which may not be turned on and cause the app to crash.

*Solution*: Enable a Cleanup Policy with *Device settings will be reset* option checked. If no Cleanup Policy is enabled, enter the following command in xref:manual-testing:device-controls.adoc#_adb_shell[adb shell]:
