:navtitle: Use image injection

Learn how to test your app camera using image injection, so you can ensure end-users can take photos or scan QR codes with your app.

== Before you start

There are 2 ways to enable image injection for your app:

* Either enable *Instrument application for camera injection* when xref:manual-testing:install-an-app.adoc[installing your app] before you test your in-app camera.
* Or follow xref:apps:image-injection-sdk/add-the-sdk-to-your-android-app.adoc[this guide] to add Kobiton image injection SDK into your Android apps.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not enable *Instrument application for camera injection* when installing an app that already has image injection SDK added.

== Add an image to the library

To add an image to your injection library, select *Image Injection*, *Set Simulated Image*, then choose one or more `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files from your computer.

== Inject an image

To inject an image into your app, launch the app and open the in-app camera. Choose an image from the library, then select *Inject*.
