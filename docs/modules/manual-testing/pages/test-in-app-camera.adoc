Learn how to test your in-app camera using image injection during a manual session.

== Before you start

You'll need to enable *Instrument application for camera injection* when xref:install-an-app.adoc[installing your app] before you can test your in-app camera.

== Add an image

You can add an image to the injection library by opening *Image Injection*, selecting *Set Simulated Image*, then uploading one or more `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files from your computer.

== Inject an image

Now that you've added some images to your library, launch your app and select the in-app camera. Choose an image from the library and select *Inject* to test your app's camera.

When you're finished, select *reset camera* to stop injection.

== Remove an image

At any time, you can remove an image from your injection library. From your xref:device-controls.adoc[device controls], select *Image Injection*, then choose an image and select *Clear Image* to remove it from your library.
