== Scripts

Scripts contain one or more space-separated xref:_functions[functions]. Depending on the specific function, zero or more xref:_parameters[parameters] can be assigned to the function. If a parameter is required for a function, it'll be surrounded with `<>`, otherwise it'll be surrounded with `[]`.

down(0%, 0%, 3) move(50%, 50%, 3) up(3) // Places the 4th finger on the screen at 0%, 0%, moves the finger to 50%, 50%, and then removes the finger.

[#_functions]
== Functions

[#_arc]
=== `arc(<x>, <y>, <angle>, [finger], [duration])`

`arc()` draws an arc from -360 to 360 degrees. Use xref:_x_and_y[`x`] and xref:_x_and_y[`y`] to set the center of the arc, and xref:_angle[`angle`] to set the arc's angle in degrees.

By default, xref:_finger[`finger`] is set to `0` and xref:_duration[`duration`] is set to `2s`.

[source,]
----
down(50%, 50%) arc(50%, 50%, 180) // Draws a semi-circle starting and ending at the center of the screen.
down(50%, 50%) arc(50%, 50%, 0) // Draws a point at the center of the screen.
down(50%, 50%) arc(50%, 50%, 360) // Draws a full circle starting and ending at the center of the screen.
----

[#_down]
=== `down(<x>, <y>, [finger])`

`dow()` places a finger on the screen at the xref:_x_and_y[`x`] and xref:_x_and_y[`y`] coordinates. By default, xref:_finger[`finger`] will be set to `0`, unless you choose a different finger. The `finger` won't move unless called in another function.

[source,]
----
down(1px, 400px) // Places a finger at 1px, 400px using the pixels of your computer monitor.
down(400dp, 1dp) // Places a finger at 400px, 1px using the pixels of the mobile device screen.
down(1%, 100%) // Places a finger at 1%, 100% by multiplying the length of the mobile device screen by its relevant axis.
----

[#_move]
=== `move(<x>, <y>, [finger], [duration])`

`move()` swipes a finger from its current location to the location specified in `move()`. By default, xref:_finger[`finger`] will be set to `0` and xref:_duration[`duration`] will be set to `2s`.

[NOTE]
If there's no `finger` on the screen yet, xref:_down[`down()`] will be called instead.

[source,]
----
down(50%, 50%) move(75%, 75%) // Places a finger at 50%, 50% then moves it to 75%, 75%.
down(50%, 50%) move(25%, 25%) // Places a finger at 50%, 50% then moves it to 25%, 25%.
down(50%, 50%) move(100%, 0%) // Places a finger at 50%, 50% then moves it to 100%, 0%.
----

[#_sync]
=== `sync([finger])`

`sync()` waits for all function calls to finish before calling more functions. If xref:_finger[`finger`] is assigned, `sync()` only applies to function calls using that `finger`.

[source,]
----
down(0) sync() down(1) // Wait for all functions to finish before placing the 2nd finger down.
down(0) sync(1) down(1) // Wait for the 1st finger to finish before placing the 2nd finger down.
down(0) sync(0) down(1) // Place the 2nd finger down immediately, since sync() was only applied to the 1st finger.
----

[#_up]
=== `up([finger])`

`up()` removes a finger from the screen. By default, xref:_finger[`finger`] will be set to `0`, unless you choose a different finger.

[source,]
----
up() // Removes the 1st finger from the screen since a finger wasn't specified.
up(5) // Removes the 6th finger from the screen.
----

[#_wait]
=== `wait(<duration>)`

`wait()` waits for `duration` before calling more functions.

[source,]
----
wait(20ms) // Waits for 20 milliseconds before calling another function.
wait(30s) // Waits for 30 seconds before calling another function.
----

[#_parameters]
== Parameters

[#_angle]
=== `angle`

`angle` determines the angle of xref:_arc[`arc()`].Set to an integer ranging from `-360` to `360`.Positive integers are draw `arc()` clockwise and negative integers draw `arc()` counterclockwise.

[source,]
----
down(50%, 50%) arc(50%, 50%, 180) // Draws a semi-circle starting and ending at the center of the screen.
down(50%, 50%) arc(50%, 50%, 0) // Draws a point at the center of the screen.
down(50%, 50%) arc(50%, 50%, 360) // Draws a full circle starting and ending at the center of the screen.
----

[#_duration]
=== `duration`

`duration` determines the duration of a function and can be set to any positive integer. By default, `duration` uses milliseconds. Alternatively, append `ms` (milliseconds) or `s` (seconds) to the integer.

[source,]
----
wait(50) // Waits for 50 milliseconds.
wait(30ms) // Waits for 30 milliseconds.
wait(8s) // Waits for 8 seconds.
----

[#_finger]
=== `finger`

`finger` determines which finger to use for a gesture and can be set to an integer ranging from `0` to `9`. By default, `finger` is set to `0`. Use a different `finger` for different xref:_functions[functions] to create multi-touch gestures, like a two-finger swipe or pinch.

[source,]
----
down(50%, 50%, 0) // Places the first finger on the center of the screen.
move(1px, 400px, 8) // Swipes the ninth finger from pixel 1 to pixel 400 on the screen.
up(4) // Removes the fifth finger from the screen.
----

[#_x_and_y]
=== `x` and `y`

`x` and `y` determines the xref:_functions[function's] location on the device screen. By default, `x` and `y` uses to pixels. Alternatively, append `px` (pixels), `dp` (device-independent pixels), or `%` (percent) to the `x` or `y` integer.

[source,]
----
down(1px, 400px) // Places a finger at 1px, 400px using the pixels of your computer monitor.
down(400dp, 1dp) // Places a finger at 400px, 1px using the pixels of the mobile device screen.
down(1%, 100%) // Places a finger at 1%, 100% by multiplying the length of the mobile device screen by its relevant axis.
