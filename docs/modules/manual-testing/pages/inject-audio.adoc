= Inject audio during a manual session (Beta)
:navtitle: Use audio injection (Beta)

== Overview

Audio injection allows audio files to be delivered to devices during manual testing sessions, enabling testing scenarios that involve recorded or real-time audio input.

== Prerequisites

Before using audio injection in a manual session, ensure the following requirements are met:

* A *Private device* that supports Bluetooth audio

* The device is running in *Standard mode*
+
NOTE: Lightning mode-enabled devices are currently not supported

* A valid audio file that meets the supported format and size requirements

Audio injection is available only on devices with Bluetooth audio support.

=== Supported audio format

Audio files must meet the following requirements:

|===
| Requirement | Value

| Container | WAV (PCM 16-bit), OGG, or MP3
| Sample Rate | 8 kHz
| Channels | mono
| Max File Size | 30 MB
|===

Files that do not meet these requirements cannot be injected, or only inject static noise.

== Using audio injection during a manual session

. From the *Device List*, select a device marked with the microphone icon and start a manual session.

. In the session toolbar, open *Inject Media* and select the *Audio Injection* tab.
+
The panel displays an empty state prompting you to upload a file. The *Inject* button remains disabled until a file is uploaded.

. Upload an audio file by clicking the upload area or dragging and dropping the file into the panel.

. On the device, open the target application (for example, a voice recorder or phone app) and ensure it is ready to capture audio input.

. Select *Inject*.
+
The panel displays an _Injecting…_ status. On the device screen, the waveform and recording timer confirm that playback is in progress.

. When injection completes, a confirmation banner indicates that the audio file was injected successfully.

== Reviewing session artifacts

To view session artifacts, after ending the session, open xref:session-explorer:manage-sessions.adoc[Session Overview,window=read-later]. Under *Audio tracks*, you can download:

* *Input audio* – the uploaded audio file

* *Injected audio* – the audio delivered to the device

* *Output audio* – the audio captured from the device

These artifacts help verify injection behavior and analyze results.

== Tips & best practices

* *Filter supported devices*
+
Use the search filter *Audio → Supported* to display only devices with Bluetooth audio enabled.
+

* *Verify audio format before upload*
+
Ensure the file meets the supported format and size requirements.
* *Prepare the app before injecting audio*
+
Open the recording or target app and start recording before selecting *Inject*.

== Troubleshooting

* *Inject button is disabled*
+
Confirm a file has been uploaded and meets format and size requirements.

* *Inject option is not available*
+
Verify that Bluetooth audio is enabled for the device.
+
Bluetooth audio is not available by default in all environments.
Contact Kobiton Support to enable Bluetooth audio if it is not available on your Private or local device.

* *No audio is recorded*
+
Ensure the microphone is not muted.
+
Confirm the target app is actively recording or listening.
+
Check device volume and in-app input settings.
+
On Android, some apps require Bluetooth to be selected as the audio input in system settings.

== Notes

* *Bluetooth host limits*
** One Mac mini host supports multiple Bluetooth hosts
** One Bluetooth host supports one device

* *Audio output support*
** Supported: HFP (calls, Google Meet, Zoom)
** Not supported: A2DP (YouTube, music, media playback)
