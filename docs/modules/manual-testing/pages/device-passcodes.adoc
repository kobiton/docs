After that, launch a manual session. Before entering the manual session, you will be asked to set a passcode. You can choose between PIN number or text passcode.

Upon exiting the session, you can choose to keep the passcode or remove it. If you remove the passcode, you will need to set a new one in your next session. If you keep the passcode, you will need to enter it the next time you launch a session.

NOTE: The passcode will be visible to admins in the Device Details modal.

== Auto-generated passcode or PIN

As mentioned above, the PIN and passcode mode must be activated for you by the Kobiton team. Once the device is enabled with pin or passcode, you will launch the device from the Portal without the need to enter the the passcode. When in a manual session, you can check the device passcode by turning off the screen and turning it on again. By doing this, you'll see the device *automatically* filling in the passcode and unlocking the device.
