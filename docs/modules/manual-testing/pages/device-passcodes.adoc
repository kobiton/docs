$DESCRIPTION$

== Auto-generated passcode or PIN

As mentioned above, the PIN and passcode mode must be activated for you by the Kobiton team. Once the device is enabled with pin or passcode, you will launch the device from the Portal without the need to enter the passcode. When in a manual session, you can check the device passcode by turning off the screen and turning it on again. By doing this, you'll see the device *automatically* filling in the passcode and unlocking the device.
