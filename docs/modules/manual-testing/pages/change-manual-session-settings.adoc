== Disable the session timeout

By default, manual sessions will automatically time out after 10 minutes of inactivity. To disable session timeouts for the current session, uncheck the box.

[NOTE]
We recommend keeping session timeouts enabled when you're using a public device so you can avoid using testing minutes if you forget to end the session.

== Disable the cleanup policy

To disable the device's cleanup policy for the current session, uncheck the box. For more information, see xref:organization:teams/create-a-device-cleanup-policy.adoc[Device cleanup policies].
