== Troubleshooting

The following sections describe common issues that may occur during *Google Pay* testing.

=== Black screen when adding a Google account

On Android 12 and newer, a black screen may appear during Google account sign-in if a device passcode is set. This blocks the login flow and prevents the account from being added.
