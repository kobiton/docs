= Kobiton Audio Injection User Guide
:navtitle:

*Audio Injection* lets you play a local audio file directly into a connected device during a manual session—perfect for testing recording apps, voice flows, and audio handling.

== Prerequisites

* A device that supports audio injection.
** In **Card View** of the **Kobiton Device List**, compatible devices show a *microphone* icon under *Private & Local Devices*. For example, a device labeled `36.167 – Audio – Pixel 7` appears as online and ready to launch. _({Screenshot 1})_
* A valid audio file that meets the required format and size.

=== Supported audio format

|===
| Requirement | Value

| Container | WAV (PCM)
| Sample Rate | 8 kHz
| Bit Depth | 16-bit
| Channels | Mono
| Max File Size | 30 MB
|===

[WARNING]
====
Only **8 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM WAV** files up to **30 MB** are accepted. Other formats or sizes are rejected.
====

== Quick start

. **Pick a compatible device.**
In the Device List (Card View), choose a device marked with the microphone icon and launch a *Manual Session*. _({Screenshot 1})_

. **Open the Audio Injection panel.**
In the session, open **Inject Media** and select the **Audio Injection** tab. You’ll see an empty state inviting you to *click* or *drag-and-drop* a file. The **Inject** button is disabled until a file is uploaded. _({Screenshot 2})_

. **Select your file.**
Click the upload area to open your system file browser (e.g., *Downloads*). Highlight your WAV file (e.g., `sample.wav`) and press **Open**. File details such as size (e.g., *2.3 MB*), type (*Waveform audio*), and date added are shown in the OS dialog. _({Screenshot 4})_

. **Confirm upload.**
After the file is uploaded, the panel lists its name (e.g., `sample.wav`) plus *size* and *duration* (e.g., `00:05`). The **Inject** button becomes active. _({Screenshot 3})_

. **Prepare the device to receive audio.**
Open the target application on the device (e.g., a voice recorder screen showing waveform/timer) so it’s ready to capture the injected playback. _({Screenshot 3})_

. **Inject audio.**
Click **Inject**. The panel shows the status **Injecting…** above the purple action bar. On the device screen, the waveform and recording timer confirm playback is occurring; the device log panel continues to stream real-time activity. _({Screenshot 5})_

. **Verify completion.**
When playback finishes, the session shows a confirmation banner: *“Audio file `sample.wav` has been injected successfully.”* The device waveform and elapsed time indicate playback ended, and logs continue to capture related activity. _({Screenshot 6})_

== Reviewing session artifacts

After the session, open the **Session Summary** to review metadata (session name, duration, status, timestamps) and device information (e.g., *Google Pixel 7 Pro, Android 16*). A session recording video is available for playback. _({Screenshot 7})_

Under **Audio tracks**, you can download:

* **Input Audio** — the raw input captured from the device microphone during the session.
* **Injected Audio** — the exact audio file that was injected.
* **Output Audio** — the device’s output capture (what the app or device produced during/after injection).

These assets let you compare what was sent to the device versus what the device/app recorded or output. _({Screenshot 7})_

== Detailed workflow

=== 1) Identify and launch a compatible device
* In the **Device List → Card View**, filter or visually scan for devices with the *microphone* icon indicating audio injection capability.
* Launch a **Manual Session** on an available device. _({Screenshot 1})_

=== 2) Open the Audio Injection tab
* In the session, open **Inject Media** → **Audio Injection**.
* The empty state clearly lists supported format and size limits (8 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM WAV, ≤30 MB).
* **Inject** remains inactive until a valid file is uploaded. _({Screenshot 2})_

=== 3) Upload a file
* Drag-and-drop a file into the panel *or* click to open the OS file picker.
* In the file picker, select your `.wav` (e.g., `sample.wav`) and click **Open**. _({Screenshot 4})_

=== 4) Validate file details
* After upload, the panel shows:
** File name (e.g., `sample.wav`)
** File size (e.g., *2.3 MB*)
** Duration (e.g., `00:05`)
* The **Inject** button is now enabled. _({Screenshot 3})_

=== 5) Prepare the app under test
* Navigate the device to the target screen (e.g., voice recorder, voice chat, IVR/voice prompt, etc.).
* Ensure it’s ready to record/receive the injected audio. _({Screenshot 3})_

=== 6) Start injection and monitor
* Click **Inject** to begin playback into the connected device.
* The UI shows **Injecting…**, and the device screen displays waveform/timer activity.
* Watch the **device log panel** for real-time events during injection. _({Screenshot 5})_

=== 7) Completion and confirmation
* On success, a banner confirms: *“Audio file `sample.wav` has been injected successfully.”*
* The panel returns to post-playback state with your file listed; device UI reflects the finished audio. _({Screenshot 6})_

=== 8) Post-session review and downloads
* In **Session Summary**, review session/device details and play back the session video.
* Download **Input Audio**, **Injected Audio**, and **Output Audio** to compare sources and results. _({Screenshot 7})_

== Tips & best practices

* **Verify format before upload.** Convert to *8 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM WAV* and keep under *30 MB* to avoid rejections.
* **Stage the device app first.** Open the recording or target app and get it ready *before* clicking **Inject**.
* **Watch logs live.** Use the device log to confirm app events triggered by the injected audio.
* **Use concise samples.** Shorter clips (a few seconds) make iteration faster and keep under size limits.

== Troubleshooting

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Symptom | Resolution

| **Inject button is disabled** | Ensure a file is uploaded and that it meets the required format (8 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM WAV) and size (≤30 MB). _({Screenshot 2})_
| **Upload fails or file rejected** | Confirm the file type is PCM WAV, not compressed (e.g., MP3). Re-export/convert to the exact specs and try again.
| **No audio recorded in the app** | Make sure the target app is actively recording or listening when you click **Inject**. Verify device volume and any in-app input settings. Check the device log panel for clues during playback. _({Screenshot 5})_
| **Unsure what was actually played** | Download **Injected Audio** from the Session Summary and compare with **Input** and **Output** tracks to isolate source vs. recorded differences. _({Screenshot 7})_
