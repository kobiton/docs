:navtitle: Inject audio (Beta)

Learn how to inject an audio file directly into a connected device during a manual session to test recording apps, voice calls, and audio handling.

== Prerequisites

* A private device with bluetooth audio enabled running in *Standard mode*.

[IMPORTANT]
Bluetooth audio requires an additional _bluetooth-bridge_ server to enable. Contact Kobiton support for more details.

* A valid audio file that meets the required format and size.

=== Supported audio format

|===
| Requirement | Value

| Container | WAV (PCM 16-bit), OGG, or MP3
| Sample Rate | 8 kHz
| Channels | mono
| Max File Size | 30 MB
|===

== Inject audio

* In the *Device List*, choose a device marked with the microphone icon and launch a *Manual Session*.

* In the session, open *Inject Media* and select the *Audio Injection* tab. You’ll see an empty state inviting you to *click* or *drag-and-drop* a file. The *Inject* button is disabled until a file is uploaded.

* Select the upload area to open your system file browser (e.g., *Downloads*). Highlight your audio file (e.g., `sample.wav`) and select *Open*.

* Open the target application on the device (e.g., a voice recorder app or phone app) so it’s ready to capture the injected audio.

* Choose *Inject*. The panel shows the status *Injecting…* above the purple action bar. On the device screen, the waveform and recording timer confirm playback is occurring.

* When the injection finishes, the session shows a confirmation banner: `Audio file [file_name] has been injected successfully.`

== Reviewing session artifacts

After the session, open xref:session-explorer:manage-sessions.adoc[Session Overview,window=read-later]. Under *Audio tracks*, you can download:

* *Input audio*: the uploaded audio tracks.
* *Injected audio*: the audio tracks that were injected to the device.
* *Output audio*: the output audio tracks.

== Tips & best practices

* *Filter devices with bluetooth audio enabled*
+
Filter only devices with bluetooth audio enabled by selecting *Audio* -> *Supported* in the search bar.

* *Verify format before upload.*
+
Convert the audio file to *WAV (PCM 16-bit), OGG, or MP3* and keep the file size under *30 MB*.
* *Stage the device app first.*
+
Open the recording or target app and get it ready *before* clicking *Inject*.
