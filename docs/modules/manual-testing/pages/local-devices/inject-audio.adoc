= Inject audio during a manual session
:navtitle: Inject audio

*Audio Injection* lets you play a local audio file directly into a connected device during a manual session—perfect for testing recording apps, voice flows, and audio handling.

== Prerequisites

* A device with bluetooth audio enabled. Contact Kobiton support for more details on how to enable bluetooth audio.
* A valid audio file that meets the required format and size.

=== Supported audio format

|===
| Requirement | Value

| Container | WAV (PCM)
| Sample Rate | 8 kHz
| Bit Depth | 16-bit
| Channels | Mono
| Max File Size | 30 MB
|===

== Inject audio

* In the *Device List*, choose a device marked with the microphone icon and launch a *Manual Session*. _({Screenshot 1})_

[TIP]
You can filter only devices with bluetooth audio enabled by selecting *Audio* -> *Supported* in the search bar.

* In the session, open *Inject Media* and select the *Audio Injection* tab. You’ll see an empty state inviting you to *click* or *drag-and-drop* a file. The *Inject* button is disabled until a file is uploaded. _({Screenshot 2})_

* Select the upload area to open your system file browser (e.g., *Downloads*). Highlight your WAV file (e.g., `sample.wav`) and press *Open*. File details such as size (e.g., *2.3 MB*), type (*Waveform audio*), and date added are shown in the OS dialog. _({Screenshot 4})_

* After the file is uploaded, the panel lists its name (e.g., `sample.wav`) plus *size* and *duration* (e.g., `00:05`). The *Inject* button becomes active. _({Screenshot 3})_

* Open the target application on the device (e.g., a voice recorder screen showing waveform/timer) so it’s ready to capture the injected playback. _({Screenshot 3})_

* Choose *Inject*. The panel shows the status *Injecting…* above the purple action bar. On the device screen, the waveform and recording timer confirm playback is occurring; the device log panel continues to stream real-time activity. _({Screenshot 5})_

* When playback finishes, the session shows a confirmation banner: *“Audio file `sample.wav` has been injected successfully.”* The device waveform and elapsed time indicate playback ended, and logs continue to capture related activity. _({Screenshot 6})_

== Reviewing session artifacts

After the session, open the *Session Overview*. Under *Audio tracks*, you can download:

* *Input Audio* — the raw input captured from the device microphone during the session.
* *Injected Audio* — the exact audio file that was injected.
* *Output Audio* — the device’s output capture.

These assets let you compare what was sent to the device versus what the device/app recorded or output. _({Screenshot 7})_

== Tips & best practices

* *Verify format before upload.* Convert to *8 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM WAV* and keep under *30 MB* to avoid rejections.
* *Stage the device app first.* Open the recording or target app and get it ready *before* clicking *Inject*.
* *Watch logs live.* Use the device log to confirm app events triggered by the injected audio.
* *Use concise samples.* Shorter clips (a few seconds) make iteration faster and keep under size limits.

== Troubleshooting

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Symptom | Resolution

| *Inject button is disabled* | Ensure a file is uploaded and that it meets the required format (8 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM WAV) and size (≤30 MB). _({Screenshot 2})_
| *Upload fails or file rejected* | Confirm the file type is PCM WAV, not compressed (e.g., MP3). Re-export/convert to the exact specs and try again.
| *No audio recorded in the app* | Make sure the target app is actively recording or listening when you click *Inject*. Verify device volume and any in-app input settings. Check the device log panel for clues during playback. _({Screenshot 5})_
| *Unsure what was actually played* | Download *Injected Audio* from the Session Summary and compare with *Input* and *Output* tracks to isolate source vs. recorded differences. _({Screenshot 7})_
