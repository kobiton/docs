:navtitle: Resume a session

Learn how to resume a test session after you experience an unexpected disruption, like a browser crash, a network disconnection, or a computer powering down. Your session will remain active for *10 minutes* before automatically timing out.

[NOTE]
If you were using a public device, you'll be charged testing minutes during idle time. You can change your default idle time, in xref:profile:your-profile.adoc#_change_your_session_timeout[your profile].

== Resume your session

To resume your session, go to *Devices*, find the device you were using, and select *Connect*.
