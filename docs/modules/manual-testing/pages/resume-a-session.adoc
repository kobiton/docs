:navtitle: Resume a session

Learn how to resume a test session after experiencing unexpected disruptions, like your browser crashing, your network disconnecting, or your computer powering down.

We'll keep your session active for 10 minutes before ending the session. If you were using a public device, you'll be charged testing minutes during this time (since others may be waiting to use this device). To change the length of the idle time, go to your xref:profile:manage-your-profile.adoc#_change_your_session_timeout[profile settings].

== Resume your session

To resume your session, go to *Devices*, find the device you were using, and select *Connect*. You'll start right where you left off.
