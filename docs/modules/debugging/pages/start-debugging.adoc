:navtitle: Start debugging

Learn how to start debugging using the virtualUSB desktop app so you can debug devices from anywhere.

[NOTE]
You can also start a debug session using the xref:debugging:virtualusb-cli-commands.adoc[virtualUSB command-line interface tool].

== Before you start

You'll need to complete the following:

* xref:debugging:set-up-virtualusb.adoc[] on your personal computer.
* xref:debugging:local-devices/configure-your-personal-computer.adoc[Configure your personal computer] (for *Standalone/On-Prem with self-signed SSL certificate only*).

== Start a virtualUSB session

Launch the virtualUSB desktop app.

Search for a device using the search bar. You can search by *Display Name*, *Model Name*, or *UDID*.

Select *Connect* to start a virtualUSB session using the selected device.

Once connected:

* The device status changes to *Retained*. This status persists for 24 hours unless the device is disconnected sooner.

* The *Connection Status* column displays the value *Connected*.

Repeat this step to connect to additional devices.

To filter and view the list of currently connected devices, select the *Show Connected Devices* checkbox. Unselect the checkbox to clear the filter and view all devices.

== Observe mobile screen in a virtualUSB session

To observe what is happening on the device screen while connected to a device via virtualUSB:

. Sign in to the Kobiton Portal.

. Find the device and launch a manual session with a virtualUSB.

[TIP]
Copy the device UDID from virtualUSB and paste it in the search bar of the Kobiton Portal Device List.

Manual sessions will end after staying idle for a certain period of time. To prevent an accidental session end:

. Open the *Manual Session Settings* while in the manual session.

. Uncheck *Quit session after staying idle for 10 minutes* in the pop-up.

Confirm the action by selecting *Disconnect* in the next dialog:

== Save log

To save a log of activities in virtualUSB, click the *Save Logs* icon:

In the next dialog, choose a time period from the dropdown list and click *Save*. A zip archive containing all the logs in the selected period will be downloaded.

== Considerations

* Admins are able to cancel a device retained for virtualUSB. Once cancelled, the device will be released, meaning that device is no longer connected with user's workstation. However, the user will see the Connection status as *Error* and the button stays at *Disconnect*. To re-connect to this device, the user needs to disconnect and then connect again.

* After clicking the *Connect* button, users may occasionally see the connection status change to *Offline* or *Error* before showing *Connected*.

* If a user right-clicks on any part of the virtualUSB app and selects *Reload*, the user will be directed back to the login page and must sign in again.

* You cannot run virtualUSB from a Mac that has deviceConnect or Kobiton Desktop installed.

* Device connection status is not synced across machines when a user logs in to virtualUSB on different machines simultaneously.

* When a device is connected via virtualUSB and you restart the device:

** The virtualUSB connection will be re-established.

** The device status will be back to *Retained* until timed out.

* The connection status of the devices may not sync between virtualUSB with UI and virtualUSB command-line interface (CLI). It is recommended to use only 1 interface of virtualUSB when connecting and disconnecting devices on 1 machine.

* In the zip file exported using the *save log* feature, the created and modified date time of some of the files and folders are displayed incorrectly as _January 1, 1980 at 12:00 AM_.

* iOS 17 and above devices are not supported.

* iOS device support for virtualUSB on Windows is not available.
