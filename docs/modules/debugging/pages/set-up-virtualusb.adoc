:navtitle: Set up virtualUSB
:tabs-sync-option:

Learn how to set up virtualUSB on your personal computer so you can debug *local* and *private* devices.

[NOTE]
You'll need to xref:debugging:local-devices/configure-your-personal-computer.adoc[configure your personal computer] after you complete these steps.

== Before you start

You'll need a personal computer with the following system specifications:


[tabs]
======
macOS::
+

* MacOS Monterey 12 or later.

* Xcode 13 or higher (be sure to select a version that works with the iOS versions to be tested)

Windows::

* Windows 10 or later.

======

[IMPORTANT]
For both MacOS and Windows, administrative privilege is required to set up and use virtualUSB.

== Android requirements

To connect to Android devices via virtualUSB, you must install Android Debug Bridge (`adb`) from the https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads[Android SDK Platform-Tools,window=read-later] package. If you don't already have `adb` on your workstation, download it from Android or install an IDE like Android Studio.

Follow the https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables[official Android developer guide] to set up the required environment variables for adb. You can also run the below example commands to set the environment variables.

[tabs]
======
macOS with Zsh shell::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
export ANDROID_HOME=path/to/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
----
[NOTE]
Replace `path/to/Android/sdk` with the actual location of SDK installation directory (the folder containing `platform-tools`).
--

Windows::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
set ANDROID_HOME=C:\path\to\Android\Sdk
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
----
[NOTE]
Replace `C:\path\to\Android\Sdk` with the actual location of SDK installation directory (the folder containing `platform-tools`).
--
======

== For MacOS only: Prepare debug symbols for iOS devices

If your network has a low bandwidth, fetching debug symbol files for Xcode via virtualUSB can be slow and unreliable. In such cases, you'll need to manually prepare the debug symbols, which are specific to the device’s iOS version. If needed, contact our Support team and request the debug symbols for your devices. Then, copy the debug symbols to your local Mac folder:
[source]
/Users/<your username>/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/

== Clean up previous virtualUSB version before installing new version

If you have installed virtualUSB previously, we recommend uninstalling the old version before installing a new one. See xref:uninstall-virtualusb.adoc[Uninstall virtualUSB,window=read-later] for guidance.

== Download virtualUSB

For *Cloud and Hybrid* customers, select the *Download* button on the navigation bar of the Kobiton Portal, then download the appropriate virtualUSB package.
