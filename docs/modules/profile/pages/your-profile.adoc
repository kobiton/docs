[NOTE]
If your manual session is xref:manual-testing:resume-a-session.adoc[unexpected interrupted], we'll keep your session active for the length of your session timeout. Keep in mind: you'll be charged testing minutes for public device sessions we keep active, since others may be waiting to use the device.
