== Manual sessions

=== Why do I see a black screen during a manual session on Android?

A black screen can appear during an Android manual session for a few reasons. One common cause is the use of the `FLAG_SECURE` setting in an app. This setting helps protect sensitive content by blocking screenshots and screencast for specific windows, such as login screens.

[NOTE]

Although the screen is black, you can still use the Inspector in a xref:manual-testing:device-information/inspector.adoc[manual session,window=read-later] or xref:session-explorer:analytics/reinspect-appium-elements.adoc[Session Explorer,window=read-later] to inspect elements on the screen.

Suggested solutions and workarounds for the black screen issue:

* Ask the app developers for a debug version of the app without the `FLAG_SECURE` setting enabled.

* If you're familiar with the screen layout, open _adb shell_ during the manual session and use input commands to navigate past the black screen. The next question shows this in action for Google Play login on passcode-protected devices.

=== How can I bypass the black screen when logging into Google Play Store (device with passcode)?

On passcode-enabled devices with Android 12 and later, during a manual session, the screen turns black when logging into Google Play.

The black screen is actually the passcode input screen. This screen has been protected from screen sharing to prevent recording of passcode input.

To bypass this screen in a manual session:

* Copy the passcode in the session information (only for organizations with passcode enabled).

* Open xref:manual-testing:device-controls.adoc#_adb_shell[adb shell terminal,window=read-later] from the device actions toolbar.

* Type `input text <passcode>` (replace `<passcode>` with the copied passcode) and hit *Enter* on the keyboard. This command enters the passcode on the device screen.

* Type `input keyevent 66` and hit *Enter* on the keyboard. This simulates the *Enter* key in the virtual keyboard.

* You can then move on to the next screen, which is no longer protected from screen sharing.
