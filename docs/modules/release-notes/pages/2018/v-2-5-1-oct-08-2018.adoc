== Automation Test For Organization Management

* Implementing the new user interface and logic for the automation testing to adapt the Organization Management feature. Kobiton will automatically set your first assigned group as “Default Group,” which can be manually changed.

[NOTE]
Now in the Profile settings, you can select the https://support.kobiton.com/organization-management/automation-for-groups/default-group-setting/[“Default Group”] for the automation testing. “Default Group” is used to check and store the generated automation sessions when you don’t specify the groupID in the desired capabilities. In contrast, with the groupID in https://support.kobiton.com/automation-testing/desired-capabilities-usage/[desired capabilities], your sessions will be generated based on the defined group.
