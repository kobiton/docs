* Android version >= 5: automationName = UiAutomator2

== API

* Kobiton now supports https://api.kobiton.com/docs/#get-metric-url-stream[Stream API] to fetch device system metrics: CPU, Memory (RAM), WIFI (ingoing / outgoing) of a running session on both iOS and Android.

== Device Cleanup

* Kobiton now offers users who use Device Lab Management to host / manage their own devices, a flexible method to control a cleanup process. Kobiton’s users are able to include / exclude the https://support.kobiton.com/device-lab-management/device-cleanup-policy/device-cleanup[Cleanup Activities] (refer to the list below) after exiting a manual / automation session:
** Remove apps installed within a session

** Reset device settings (turn on WIFI, USB Debugging, turn off Airplane Mode…)
** Remove signed-in accounts (Gmail, Facebook...)
