== Improvements

=== Automation test

* Capture and download network activity log (HAR file) of browser on iOS and Android devices for analyzing performance bottlenecks and security issues

During automation testing, Kobiton always overrides `automationName` in `desiredCaps` with:

* `Appium` for Android device
* `XCUITest` for iOS device

== REST API breaking changes

* Remove `commands` field on the response of `GET /sessions/:sessionId`. See the updated endpoint at https://api.kobiton.com/docs/#get-a-session[API docs > Get a session].
* Add new endpoint `GET /sessions/:sessionId/commands` for retrieving a list of session commands. See the new created endpoint at https://api.kobiton.com/docs/#get-session-commands[API Docs > Get session commands]
