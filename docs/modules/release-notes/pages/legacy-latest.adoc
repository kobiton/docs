As a reminder, last year, we started using 4.0+ as the numbering for releases of the new Kobiton, while Legacy Kobiton will continue with numbering starting with 3.25 and above. If you are using the new Kobiton, see xref:kobiton-four-latest.adoc[].

If you have any questions or would like to update your Kobiton system, mailto:support@kobiton.com[contact support].
