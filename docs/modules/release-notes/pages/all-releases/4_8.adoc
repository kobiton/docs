== New documentation site and search widget

We are excited to introduce our new help documentation site - http://docs.kobiton.com/[docs.kobiton.com] - along with a powerful search widget integrated right within the Portal. This feature allows you to find the information you need quickly and efficiently without leaving the Portal. Keep reading to learn what’s new.

*Refreshed and streamlined help content*: Our commitment to providing you with the best support experience has led to a complete overhaul of our help content. We've refreshed, reorganized, and modernized our documentation to ensure it is in sync with the latest features and improvements introduced in Kobiton 4.

*Portal search widget*: We added the ability to search within the Portal help widget, making it easier than ever to find the information you're looking for. No need to navigate away from the Portal to search our extensive documentation. Simply enter your query, and relevant results will appear instantly for you to choose for more detail. Plus, the search results widget is resizable, allowing you to adjust the size. Use the arrow in the bottom right corner to adjust the size.

*Open help in a separate tab*: Want to keep your search results handy while using the Portal? Simply choose the "Help" link to open the search results in a separate tab, so you can refer to them side-by-side.

With this revamped documentation help site, we aim to provide you with a more efficient and user-friendly way to access the information you need, right when you need it.

We value your feedback! If you encounter any issues, please send a note to Kobiton Support.

== Scriptless Automation and sensitive data

While we strongly discourage the use of sensitive data during app testing for security reasons, we understand that there are certain scenarios where it is necessary. To accommodate these use cases, we incorporated a sensitive data input feature in the Portal.

We also recognize that some of our users who require sensitive data may want to leverage our Scriptless Automation for other test cases. We need to prioritize security and data protection. Therefore, we are implementing the following:

*Sensitive data input in manual sessions:* If you utilize our Sensitive Data feature within a manual testing session, please be aware that we now classify it as an unsupported action. As a result, if you decide to initiate a Scriptless rerun for one of these sessions, we will not proceed the test beyond the step involving sensitive data.

*Future enhancements:* Looking ahead, we plan to refine the Scriptless Automation process to better accommodate sensitive data while maintaining robust security measures. Our goal is to limit access to sensitive information to the initial tester to ensure data privacy.

We appreciate your understanding and commitment to data security.

== Cleanup Policy: disable keyboard emoji tooltip on Samsung devices

The Samsung keyboard’s emoji tooltip can impact successful Scriptless reruns on Samsung devices. So, we added a new cleanup action - _Clear the keyboard cache_ - to disable the tooltip.

If you intend to run Kobiton Scriptless with Samsung devices, we recommend you enable _Clear the keyboard cache_ in your Cleanup Policy as shown below:
