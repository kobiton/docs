:navtitle: Kobiton 4.14 release notes

_August 10, 2024_

== New OS support

Kobiton 4.14 adds support for the following:

* iOS/iPadOS 18.0 Beta 3, 18.1 Beta
* Xcode 16 Beta

== Lightning mode support for iOS 17.4 devices and later without networking changes

When Apple introduced iOS 17, they rolled out new connectivity protocols that impacted how iOS 17 devices communicated with solutions like Kobiton. These protocols required special network configurations for Kobiton Lightning Mode deployments that were not always possible for customers to implement.

With iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new communication protocol that significantly enhances connections between iOS devices and the Kobiton platform. We implemented this innovative protocol with this release. This protocol eliminates the need for the special Lightning Mode networking changes introduced with iOS 17 for iOS 17.4+ devices, simplifying your networking.

[IMPORTANT]
====

* iOS 17.0-17.3 devices continue to require special networking to support Lightning mode, so we recommend those devices are hosted on a separate Mac mini in Standard mode.

====

[NOTE]
====

* iOS 17.4 and later devices still need to be plugged into the Mac mini to establish trust before connecting to the GEM.
* Metrics are not available for iOS 17.0 to 17.3 devices.
* virtualUSB is not available for *all* iOS devices.
* There is a known issue with iOS 17.5 to 18.1 Beta devices becoming offline when starting a Network Payload Capture session. Restart deviceConnect services to make the device online again.

====

== SSO: allow non-SSO login for specific users in SSO only organizations

It is now possible to specify some users in SSO only organizations to use the Kobiton username and password to log in.

In SSO settings, when the option _Enforce users to login to Kobiton only through SSO_ is turned on, there is now a new field *_Choose users who are allowed to login without SSO_*. Search for and add existing Kobiton users to this field to allow them to log in using Kobiton username and password.

The designated users will be required to use the Forgot Password feature upon their next log in to the Portal to log in without SSO.

== Indicator for Lightning mode devices in Device List

Users can easily find devices that support Lightning mode in the Device List by:

* Selecting *Lightning mode* in the device search bar and choose *Supported*:

* Choosing *List View*, then *Edit Column*, and check *Lightning mode* to see devices with the Lightning icon:

== Script-based automation: obfuscate sensitive data in HTTP headers and Inspector of Session Explorer

Testers who input sensitive data for automated test cases can now use the new custom Appium setting `'kobiton:privateMode'` to hide the data in *Session Explorer*.

If a test step or action happens while the value of `'kobiton:privateMode'` is `true`, the details of it will be hidden in the *View HTTP Headers* and *Appium Inspector* menu of *Session Explorer*.

For test steps that do not contain private data, change the value of `'kobiton:privateMode'` back to `false` to stop the obfuscation.

Below are sample screens with obfuscated data for:

* View HTTP Headers

* Appium Inspector

[NOTE]
====
_Limitations/Notes_

* Automation sessions that have obfuscated data are not marked as sensitive sessions and can be accessed by admins and team members.
* Although the private data is obfuscated in _View HTTP Headers_ and _Appium Inspector_, it may not be obfuscated in session video, screenshots, and logs.
* Data obfuscation is only available for XIUM and Appium 2 Basic sessions.

== Auto-upgrade deviceConnect: force devices offline if deviceConnect is two major versions behind the latest

We have a new policy to ensure that Cloud and Hybrid customers have access to the latest features. Devices will now be automatically taken offline on the Kobiton portal if the deviceConnect version on the host machine is two major versions behind the current release.

This means for the v4.14 release, all devices hosted by deviceConnect v4.12 or below will become offline. Devices hosted by deviceConnect v4.13 are still online until v4.15 is released (if not updated).

[WARNING]
====

When adding a new hosting machine with deviceConnect v4.12 or earlier to an organization, neither the machine nor its devices appear on the Device Management page in the portal.

To avoid this issue, ensure that deviceConnect v4.13 or later is installed on all new hosting machines.

====

When devices are offline due to deviceConnect version being too old, you will see  `Kobiton upgrade required` under the device message in *Settings* -> *Device Management*:

If this issue occurs and automatic upgrade is enabled in your organization, the system will automatically download and install the latest version of deviceConnect. If automatic upgrades are disabled, you can manually upgrade deviceConnect on the host machine by selecting *Upgrade*.
