== deviceConnect: Improvements to provisioning profile handling

For Mac mini hosts without internet access, provisioning profiles could become invalid before expiration because Apple requires re-validation every 7 days. When this occurs, hosted iOS and iPadOS devices go offline.

Previously, applying a new valid profile in deviceConnect required multiple manual steps: removing old profiles, uploading new ones, uninstalling mobile agents, and restarting services.

With this release, deviceConnect automatically detects and applies newly uploaded provisioning profiles, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

[NOTE]
A manual service restart is still required after importing the new provisioning profile.


== Kobiton Command Line Interface (CLI)

Enterprise environments often need to control and operate devices in batches. To address this, Kobiton now provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) that supports batch operations, scripting, and streamlined management of multiple devices simultaneously.

There is also a new type of session: *CLI session*. In the Session List, filter for this session by using `type:cli` or choose _CLI_ in the search bar dropdown.

[NOTE]

====

* Private or Local devices only - Public devices not supported.

* For CLI sessions:

** No Session Explorer available.

** Session video and logs are not available in Session Overview.

** Mixed sessions between manual and CLI are not supported.

** CLI sessions time out after 10 minutes by default and can be configured for up to 2 hours. You can reset the timeout using the `kobiton session ping` command.

====

A user guide for the Kobiton CLI is available xref:kobiton-cli:index.adoc[here,window=read-later].


== Test Management: Updated display for app install test steps

With this update, _app install_ steps in the Test Case Details page now display the following instead of the _screenshot not available_ message:

* App source: App Repo or Upload

* App name

* App version

== Scriptless Improvements

* Bug Fix: Resolved an issue where deleting all test steps for an app in a test case caused any test suite using that test case to fail during execution.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where clearing the search box in the Blocker Remediation pop-up did not restore the complete view tree.


== General improvements and fixes

* deviceConnect Console: Provisioning profile deletion option restored.

* App Repo & App Install Menu: Now shows version code (Android) and short string (iOS) alongside the app version.
