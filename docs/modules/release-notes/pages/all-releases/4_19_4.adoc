:navtitle: Kobiton 4.19.4 release notes

_June 21, 2025_

== New OS support

* Xcode 26 Beta

* iOS/iPadOS 26 Beta

* iOS/iPadOS 18.4 official

* iOS/iPadOS 18.5 official

* Android 16 official

== Enhanced App Signing Support for iOS Devices

=== What's new

Support multiple provisioning profiles per device, ensuring compatibility when re-signing non-standard bundle IDs.

=== Why this matters
Apple provisioning profiles allow only one wildcard bundle IDâ€”typically in the form of `com.*`. Previously, Kobiton App Signing could only use one provisioning profile per device. This limitation made it difficult to re-sign and install apps with bundle IDs such as `org.example.app` or `co.example.app`.

With this release, Kobiton supports multiple provisioning profiles with different bundle ID wildcards, making app re-signing and installation more flexible and reliable.

=== What you need to do

* Generate provisioning profiles that cover all the bundle ID formats you use.
* Import the profiles to `deviceShare`, or contact *Kobiton Support* with the bundle ID of your apps to request profiles for Public devices.
* A step-by-step guide for creating the correct provisioning profiles for Hybrid customers will be available soon.

== Hybrid Lightning: update adb version

This release upgraded adb to version 36.0.0 on the Mac mini and GEM.

For the Mac mini, the adb service is automatically updated when you upgrade to deviceConnect 4.19.4.

For our Hybrid customers, please contact Kobiton Support to update the Kobiton software and adb on your GEM.

For our Standalone/On-Prem customers, please wait until the Standalone release announcements before upgrading adb.

== Session Resilience and Performance Improvements

* Enhanced the reliability of the device booking process to reduce the chances of encountering errors when launching or booking a device.

* Improve the performance of the `adb` server on the Lightning Mode GEM to better handle fetching multiple web contexts from Android devices.
