== New documentation site and search widget

We are excited to introduce our new help documentation site along with a powerful search widget integrated right within the Portal. This feature allows you to find the information you need quickly and efficiently without leaving the Portal. Keep reading to learn what’s new.

*Refreshed and streamlined help content:* Our commitment to providing you with the best support experience has led to a complete overhaul of our help content. We've refreshed, reorganized, and modernized our documentation to ensure it's in sync with the latest features and improvements introduced in Kobiton 4.

[NOTE]

====
We did not migrate content regarding Legacy Kobiton-specific functionality. The http://support.kobiton.com/[support.kobiton.com] site will remain accessible for the time being, ensuring a smooth transition for everyone.
====

*Portal search widget:* We added the ability to search within the Portal help widget, making it easier than ever to find the information you're looking for. No need to navigate away from the Portal to search our extensive documentation. Simply enter your query, and relevant results will appear instantly for you to choose for more detail. Plus, the search results widget is resizable, allowing you to adjust the size. Use the arrow in the bottom right corner to adjust the size.

*Open help in a separate tab:* Want to keep your search results handy while using the Portal? Simply choose the "Help" link to open the search results in a separate tab, so you can refer to them side-by-side.

With this revamped documentation help site, we aim to provide you with a more efficient and user-friendly way to access the information you need, right when you need it.

== Scriptless automation and sensitive data

While we strongly discourage the use of sensitive data during app testing for security reasons, we understand that there are certain scenarios where it is necessary. To accommodate these use cases, we have a sensitive data input feature in the Portal. We also recognize that some of our users who require sensitive data may want to leverage our Scriptless automation for other test cases. We need to prioritize security and data protection. Therefore, we are implementing the following for Scriptless:

*Sensitive data input in manual sessions:* If you utilize our Sensitive Data feature within a manual testing session, please be aware that we now classify that as an unsupported action for Scriptless. As a result, if you decide to initiate a Scriptless rerun for one of these sessions, we will not proceed with the test beyond the step involving sensitive data.

*Future enhancements:* Looking ahead, we plan to refine the Scriptless automation process to better accommodate sensitive data while maintaining robust security measures. Our goal is to limit access to sensitive information to the initial tester to ensure data privacy.

We appreciate your understanding and commitment to data security.

== Cleanup Policy: disable keyboard emoji tooltip on Samsung devices

The Samsung keyboard’s emoji tooltip can impact successful Scriptless reruns on Samsung devices. So, we added a new cleanup action - _Clear the keyboard cache_ - to disable the tooltip.

If you intend to run Kobiton Scriptless with Samsung devices, we recommend you enable _Clear the keyboard cache_ in your Cleanup Policy as shown below:

== Generate Appium Script with AI: C# - Nunit

You can now generate and export an Appium script in C# that is compatible with the Nunit testing framework. When you complete a Manual Session, select *Export Appium Script* on the _Automated Test Case_ tab, then select *C# - Nunit* from the _Testing Framework_ dropdown.

[NOTE]
====
Requirements/limitations:

* The Manual test session must qualify to be converted to an Automated test case for the Export Appium Script button to be enabled.
* Only sessions on native applications are supported. Support for Web and hybrid apps is coming soon.
* With some export options, an Appium script can be generated from Manual sessions and Revisit sessions with a passed status. The C# - Nunit option can only be generated from Manual sessions at this time.

== Script-based automation: launch a work profile app on Android devices

A https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6191949?hl=en[Work Profile] can be set up on an Android device to separate work apps and data from personal apps and data. Work apps are marked with a briefcase icon to distinguish them from personal apps.

This release includes a new desired capability - `kobiton:workApp` - to launch a selected Android work app in an Appium automation session. The value of this capability should be set to the name of the app to launch. See the Javascript example below:

[source,javascript]
----
const desiredCaps = {
  sessionName:        'Automation test session - MDM Profile',
  sessionDescription: 'This is an example for Android app',
  deviceOrientation:  'portrait',
  captureScreenshots: true,
  deviceGroup:        'ORGANIZATION',
  deviceName:         'Pixel 6',
  platformName:       'Android',
  platformVersion:    '12',
  'kobiton:workApp':  'Contacts'
  }
----

[NOTE]

====
Requirements/limitations:

* The Android device must have Work Profile enabled.
* The work profile app must be installed on the device.
* Only 1 work profile app can be launched in a session, and it must be the 1st app to launch.

== Known issues / limitations for Standalone

* Unable to uninstall apps using the _Uninstall All_ button
* SSO settings - the Verify button is blocked by a CAPTCHA message even though there is no CAPTCHA.
* Standard mode video does not display rotation correctly.
* Jira Cloud integration is Cloud only, so does not work for network configurations without Internet access. There are some known issues - ticket is created, but shows 500 error and cannot add attachments.
* Auto-generate Appium script: inputting / into a text field in the baseline session caused the auto-generated script to fail.
* Scriptless may not work properly on Android apps with animation or webviews for Android 13 and below.
