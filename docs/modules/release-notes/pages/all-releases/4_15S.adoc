:navtitle: Kobiton 4.15S release notes

_September 27, 2024_

== New OS support

This release adds support for the following:

* iOS/iPadOS 18 beta 8, 18.1 Beta
* iOS/iPadsOS 18 official
* Xcode 16 Beta
* Xcode 16 official

[NOTE]
====

For iOS/iPadOS 18, the cleanup policy does not currently clear signed-in accounts in the Mail app and Safari browser
cache.

====

[WARNING]
====

Do not update Mac mini hosts to MacOS Sequoia 15. Kobiton does not currently work with MacOS Sequoia 15 due to an Apple
change that impacted Microsoft .NET. Microsoft is planning a fix in October; we will reassess support then.

====

== SSO: Allow non-SSO login for specific users in SSO Only organizations

You can now specify users in SSO Only organizations to log in using a username and password instead of SSO.

In the *SSO Settings*, when *Enforce users to log in to Kobiton only through SSO* is enabled, a new field appears:
*Choose users who are allowed to log in without SSO*. Use this field to search for and select existing users to be able
to log in using their Kobiton username and password.

Designated non-SSO users will be required to use the *Forgot Password* feature the next time they log in to the Portal to
set up their username and password login.

== Indicator for Lightning mode devices in Device List

Users can easily find devices that support Lightning mode in the Device List by:

* Selecting *Lightning mode* in the device search bar and choosing *Supported*:

* Choosing *List View*, then *Edit Column*, and check *Lightning mode* to see devices with the Lightning icon:

== Script-based automation: Obfuscate sensitive data in HTTP headers and Inspector of Session Explorer

Testers who input sensitive data for automated test cases can use the new custom Appium setting `kobiton:privateMode`
to hide the data in *Session Explorer*.

If a test step or action happens while the value of `kobiton:privateMode` is `true`, the details of it will be hidden in
the *View HTTP Headers* and *Appium Inspector* menu of *Session Explorer*.

For test steps that do not contain private data, change the value of `kobiton:privateMode` back to `false` to stop the
obfuscation.

Below are sample views of obfuscated data in *Session Explorer*:

* *View HTTP Headers*

* *Appium Inspector

[NOTE]
====

_Limitations/Notes_

* Automation sessions that obfuscate data are not marked as sensitive sessions and can be accessed by admins and team
members.
* Although private data is obfuscated in *View HTTP Headers* and *Appium Inspector* using the custom setting, it may not
be obfuscated in session video, screenshots, and logs.
* Data obfuscation is only available for XIUM and Appium 2 Basic sessions.

== Restart a device for users without ADMIN role

Previously, only users with the *ADMIN* predefined role could restart a private or local device, and this action could
only be performed from the *Device Management* page.

With this release, users with the appropriate permission can restart a device by selecting *Restart* via

[NOTE]
====

* Users without ADMIN role must be assigned a custom role with the permission `org_setting.reboot_private_device` to use this feature.
* Non-ADMIN users with the reboot permission may only restart devices they can access via their assigned teams.
* Only devices with *Available* status or *Retained* by the current user can be restarted from the device details.

====

== Option to enable/disable unlimited retention for devices

This release introduces the option to enable/disable unlimited retention of devices for an org. In *Settings → Other Settings*,
we added the checkbox: *Allow unlimited retention*. Check or uncheck this box, then choose *Save* to enable/disable unlimited retention of devices.

[NOTE]
====

* To access the *Other Settings* page, the user must be assigned a role with the `permission org_setting.modify`.
* The *Allow unlimited retention setting* applies to the whole org. By default, this option is `true`.

====

== Monitor number of device offline errors in the last hour

Device admins can now monitor the number of device offline errors within the last hour. This information is available in
the *Error Count (1hr)* column under *Settings → Device Management*. This feature provides real-time insight, enabling
quicker identification and resolution of connectivity issues.

If the number of device offline errors in the past hour exceeds 10, a warning icon will appear next to the error count.
This icon indicates that there may be a potential hardware issue with the device. Hover over the warning icon to view
suggested actions for resolving the issue.

[NOTE]
====

In addition to hardware issues, certain actions can cause the device to go offline and increase the error count. These
actions include restarting services, unplugging and reconnecting the device, or rebooting the Mac mini/Dell server.

====

** Improved stability of Lightning-mode devices.
** Improved device battery information reporting in the Device List: temperature, percent charged, battery health, and status.
