== Update to Session Explorer and Session Overview

We’ve redesigned the user experience of Session Explorer and Session Overview to streamline usability, optimize test result analysis, and support our AI validations and partner ecosystem. Key enhancements include:

* *Improved user flows*

** Upon ending a manual session or selecting a session from *Session List*, users now land on *Session Explorer* to begin test analysis. The session video and basic session details are still available on the *Session Overview* tab.
** New validation review flow with the *Start Analysis* button to make the review process more efficient.
** *Real-time* event updates, so you don’t have to refresh the page as session processing finishes.

* *Revised layout for accessibility and speed*

** Simplified layout, prioritizing key information, and making navigation smoother.
** Quick access to essential details such as *Session Info* and *Device Info*.

* *New insights panel on Session Explorer for Test Analysis*

** Displays AI analysis results across multiple criteria, including *Crash Detection*, *Accessibility*, *Response Time* (*for xref:manual-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[Network Payload Capture] sessions*), and *Appium Self-Healing* (*for Appium sessions using xref:automation-testing:capabilities/add-flexcorrect.adoc[flexCorrect]*).

** Centralized view of all validation insights, streamlining test review.

[NOTE]
Figma integration is not currently supported with the redesigned Session Explorer.

== Tag and view tagged sessions

This release introduces session tagging capabilities, allowing for easy organization and tracking of related sessions. Whether you want to tag a nightly run or tag test sessions related to a particular function, tagging will help you identify trends with your testing.

* *Tag sessions in Appium script*

** Tags can be added directly within automation scripts using: `capabilities.setCapability("kobiton:tags", ['tag_name_1', 'tag_name_2', ... 'tag_name_n'])`.

* *Tag sessions and manage tags via API*

** New APIs enable users to assign tags after a session is complete.
** You can also use the APIs to un-assign and retrieve tags, offering additional flexibility and integration possibilities.
** These APIs can be used to tag any type of session.

* *Session List: search by tag*

** Search sessions by tag in the Session List by entering `session_tag:<session_tag_name>`.

** Search suggestions display your 5 most recently used tags within the selected time range, ensuring faster, more relevant results.

* *Execution history for tagged sessions*

** Session Overview now includes an *Execution History* section for tagged sessions.
** Displays up to five related sessions by tag, including their statuses. The last 3 sessions shown are always the most recent.
** Select a session to navigate to it or hover to see details like *Session ID* and *Creation Date*.
** The circled status indicates the current session being viewed.
** When you see _...._ it means that the session being viewed is not in the most recent five sessions.
** Selecting the tag name opens the Session List filtered by the sessions related to that tag.

== Group actions in Session Explorer timeline

Enhance your test analysis with grouped Appium commands, allowing you to better understand related steps within the timeline. Streamlined grouping helps with troubleshooting by identifying specific phases in a test sequence, improving traceability for app scenarios and alignment with test management frameworks.

*To group actions with Appium settings:*

* Use the `"kobiton:stepGroup": "<step_group_name>"` setting within your script to create named groups of related actions.
* Each command within the same group is visually represented on the Session Explorer timeline.
* Flexible naming options for step groups.

[NOTE]
You cannot set `“kobiton:stepGroup"` to a blank value. If you do, the steps will still be assigned to the previous group.

This release upgraded `adb` to version 35.0.2 on the Mac mini and GEM.

* For the Mac mini, the `adb` service is automatically updated when you upgrade to deviceConnect 4.16.
* For our Hybrid Enterprise Lightning customers who have a GEM, please contact Kobiton Support to update the Kobiton software and `adb` on your GEM.

== New virtualUSB client
