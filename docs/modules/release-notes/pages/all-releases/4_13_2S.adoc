= Kobiton 4.13.2S release notes
:navtitle: Kobiton 4.13.2S release notes

== New OS support

Kobiton 4.13.2S adds support for the following:

* iOS/iPadOS 17.4.1, 17.5 Beta, 17.5.1
* Mac OS Sonoma 14.4.1, 14.5
* Android 15 Beta 3

[NOTE]
====
* At this time, we recommend hosting iOS 17+ devices via Standard mode deployments for improved performance.
* For Android 15 Beta 3, the cleanup policy cannot remove a signed-in account.
* For iOS/iPadOS 18 Beta, network payload capture is not supported.
====

== Combined HAR files for network payload data

Previously, the network payload capture log was split into multiple .payload files. We can now consolidate multiple network log files into a single payload file, making it easier to convert to load test scripts on products like Grafana K6, JMeter, and Neoload for performance testing.

We also introduced two options for downloading the payload data:

* Include both request and response payloads.
* Include request payloads only (reduced size and optimized for load testing)

NOTE: The HAR file is downloaded as a .zip file. For Windows users, the .zip file cannot currently be extracted by the default extract tool in File Explorer. Instead, use WinRar or 7-zip to extract the HAR file on Windows.

== Image injection SDK for iOS

A custom iOS camera framework to use image injection on Kobiton devices is now available.

[NOTES]
====
* Image injection via app instrumentation is no longer available for iOS devices.
* Android still supports both the app instrumentation method and image injection SDK for Android.
====

Prerequisites/Limitations:

* iOS/iPadOS 14 or later, Xcode 14 or later.
* Download the Kobiton custom camera framework.
* Access to the applicationâ€™s source code (to implement custom library).
* There is no indicator that an app has the Kobiton camera framework implemented in the app repo.
* Inject the image after launching the camera. Doing this before launching the camera might crash the app.
* It may take up to 5 seconds for the injected image to appear in the camera view. Be patient!

A detailed user guide for the image injection SDK for iOS is xref:apps:image-injection-sdk/add-the-sdk-to-your-ios-app.adoc[now available].

== Image injection automation support

This feature introduces a custom capability (for instrumented apps) and commands to support injecting images during automation. Details are as follows:

* Set the capability 'kobiton:instrumentenabled' to true for the app instrumentation method. This capability is not required for the SDK method.
* Use the below two actions in your scripts for both instrumentation and SDK methods:
** `kobiton:setImage` : start image injection
** `kobiton:clearImage` : stop image injection (clear the image)

Prerequisites/Limitations:

* Image injection requirements for iOS and Android apply.
* Using the `'kobiton:instrumentenabled'` capability to instrument the app for camera injection does not work if in the `dc.ini` file of the Mac mini host, the value of `'Kobiton.UseInternalLegacyAppResigning'` is `false`. Change this value to `true` to fix the issue.
* Only supported in Xium automation sessions.
* The image must be located on the runner machine and be passed with `base64` encoding. Passing the image URL is not yet supported. Inject the image after launching the camera.
* Injecting the image before launching the camera might crash the app.
* Add a wait time for the image injection process to complete (up to 5 seconds) before performing the next command.

A user guide is xref:automation-testing:scripting/add-image-injection-to-appium-script.adoc[now available].

== Minor improvements and bug fixes

This release includes several enhancements and bug fixes to improve your day-to-day testing.

* Added more information about the device in the Kobiton Portal to help customer admins locate devices for troubleshooting and testers to be more efficient:
** Display the host machine name and address in the *More info* panel of a manual session.
** Add the *Slot* column in the *Device management* page to show the slot number of the device on the Cambrionix hub.
** Display the device name instead of the device model number in the Session List.

* Improved load performance and capability of Session Explorer for long sessions:
** Improve the load time of sessions with 500 test steps or more.
** Extend the maximum displayable number of steps in Session Explorer from 1000 to 5000.

* Enhanced and fixed some bugs in SSO integration:
** Change the label of the *SSO Enabled* and *Enable SSO* buttons to *SSO only*.
** When the Kobiton system automatically creates a user that logs in for the first time using SSO, set the *SSO only* attribute of that user to *true* (meaning the user can only log in using SSO).
** Change the label *Validation value* in SSO-related settings to *Assertion value*.
** Fixed a bug that prevents any ADMIN user with the *SSO only* attribute set to true from updating the *SSO only* attribute of that user and other users in an organization that does not enforce SSO login.

* Addressed the following Script-based test automation and Device Inspector items:
** Add actions, screenshots, and HTTP headers in Session Explorer for Basic Appium 2 sessions.
** Fix an issue where `sendKeys` method cannot send text to password fields in iOS.
** Fix an issue with Chrome WebView being returned instead of the desired application view in sessions with Android hybrid apps.
** Fix an issue with missing inspection data for a 4-5MB XML tree.
** Exclude some unused attributes in the XML of inspector data.
** Make the `deviceOrientation` desired capability work as intended in the automation session.
** Return `resourceId` in Device Inspector.
** New capability `'kobiton:xpath2'` to control the Xpath version used. (Use Xpath 2.0 when `true` ).
** Fixed the error `kAXErrorServerNotFound` that prevents the Device Inspector from finding elements. This fixes issues for both script based automation and Passcode devices.
** Handle an issue with arguments wrapped in arrays when executing the automation script.
** Handle an issue retrieving element by Xpath in recent versions of Chrome driver.
** Implement capability `'Mobile:isKeyboardShown'`.
** Fix automation issues on iOS 17.4.1 devices.

* Other items addressed:
** Optimize gesture performance to execute faster and smoother.
** Update the *GigaCap* service to improve performance.
** Make the *download session video* button easier to see in the Session Overview.
** Network Payload Capture: implement retry logic for iOS devices for better stability.
** API v2: the endpoint Get applications on a device now returns apps installed from both the App Repo and the Device details screen.
** Allow `.zip` file created from Windows machine that has whitespace to be uploaded and used in the App Repository.
** Admin can now re-enable an inactive account using the *Enable* button on the User management page.
** Fix the Cleanup Policy to reset the device language to *English (US)* in some device models.
