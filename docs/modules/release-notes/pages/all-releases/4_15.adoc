== New OS support

This release adds support for the following:

* iOS/iPadOS 18 beta 8
* iOS/iPadOS 18 official

[WARNING]
MacOS Sequoia 15 is *not supported* and will prevent deviceConnect from working. Do not update Mac mini hosts to MacOS 15.

[NOTE]
For iOS/IPadOS 18 Beta 8 and 18 official, the cleanup policy does not clear signed in accounts in the Mail app and Safari browser cache.



== Restart a device for users without ADMIN role

Before this release, only users with the `ADMIN` predefined role could restart a private/local device, and they could only do this from the Device Management page.

With this release, users with the appropriate permission can restart a device by selecting *Restart* via the *Device List* page.

[NOTE]
====

* Users without ADMIN role must be assigned a custom role with the permission `org_setting.reboot_private_device` to use this feature.

* Non-admin users with restart permission may only restart devices they can access via their assigned teams.

* Only devices with *Available* status or *Retained* by the current user can be restarted from the device details.

====

== Option to enable/disable unlimited retention for devices

This release introduces the option to enable/disable unlimited retention of devices for an org. In *Settings â†’ Other Settings*, we added the checkbox: *Allow unlimited retention*. Check or uncheck this box, then choose *Save* to enable/disable unlimited retention of devices.

[NOTE]

====

* To access the *Other Settings* page, the user must be assigned a role with the permission `org_setting.modify`.

* The *Allow unlimited retention* checkbox applies to the whole org. By default, this checkbox is checked.

== Script-based Automation: Launch an Appium Server session using the Flutter Integration driver (Beta)

Previously, we introduced support for launching an automation session using the Appium Flutter driver. With this released, support for automation sessions using the Appium Flutter Integration driver is available.

Before you can start using the Appium Flutter Integration driver, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* *Flutter App Preparation*: Pre-process your Flutter app-under-test to enable the Flutter Integration driver extension. This step is crucial for the Appium Flutter Integration driver to interact with your app.

* *Server Selection*: Run your automation test script using our basic Appium 2.0 server. To do this, set `'kobiton:runtime'` to `'appium'`. Please note that the Appium Flutter driver is not supported by Xium.

* *Capability Configuration*: Change the value of the capability `'appium:automationName'` to `'FlutterIntegration'`. This tells the Appium server to use the Flutter Integration driver for your test session.

* *Minimum Appium Java Client version* (for Java - TestNG or JUnit): Appium Java Client 9.3 or later is required for Appium Flutter Integration driver test script.

Appium Flutter Integration driver is in Beta version with the following limitations:

* All limitations of our basic Appium 2.0 functionality apply.

A detailed guide is coming soon!
