_September 14, 2024_

== New OS support

This release adds support for the following:

* iOS/iPadOS 18 beta 8

[NOTE]
For iOS/IPadOS 18 Beta 8, the cleanup policy does not clear signed-in accounts in the Mail app and Safari browser cache.

== Restart a device for users without ADMIN role

Before this release, only users with the `ADMIN` predefined role could restart a private/local device, and they could only do this from the Device Management page.

With this release, users with the appropriate permission can restart a device by selecting *Restart* via the *Device List* page.

[NOTE]
====

* Users without ADMIN role must be assigned a custom role with the permission `org_setting.reboot_private_device` to use this feature.

* Non-admin users with restart permission may only restart devices they can access via their assigned teams.

* Only devices with *Available* status or *Retained* by the current user can be restarted from the device details.

====

== Option to enable/disable unlimited retention for devices

This release introduces the option to enable/disable unlimited retention of devices for an org. In *Settings â†’ Other Settings*, we added the checkbox: *Allow unlimited retention*. Check or uncheck this box, then choose *Save* to enable/disable unlimited retention of devices.

[NOTE]

====

* To access the *Other Settings* page, the user must be assigned a role with the permission `org_setting.modify`.

* The *Allow unlimited retention* checkbox applies to the whole org. By default, this checkbox is checked.
