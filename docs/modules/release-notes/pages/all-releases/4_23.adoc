:navtitle: Kobiton 4.23 release notes

_Jan 17, 2026_

== New OS support

NOTE: Before upgrading Mac mini hosts to a new OS version, ensure that all connected iOS and iPadOS devices are running supported OS versions and that a compatible version of Xcode is installed. For details on which macOS and Xcode versions are required, see Apple’s https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/[compatibility information,window=read-later].

This release added support for the following:

* macOS 26 Tahoe for deviceConnect host

== Set maximum parallel tests per host

NOTE: Setting the maximum number of parallel tests requires the ADMIN predefined role.

You can now limit the number of parallel test sessions that run simultaneously on a single host (Mac mini or GEM). This helps manage capacity and performance when running many devices on one machine.

This feature is designed for Cloud and Standalone customers operating a high density of devices on their hosts. Hosts typically support up to *26 parallel sessions*, depending on hardware resources and runtime conditions.

All sessions running on devices connected to the same host count toward the parallel test limit. This includes both user-visible sessions and hidden system-managed sessions, such as sessions in cleanup, API-triggered sessions, and retained sessions. Retained sessions are counted to ensure continued access to retained devices.

When the limit is reached, no new sessions can start on the host until one or more active sessions end, and the session count drops below the limit. The limit applies only to new sessions. If an admin lowers the limit below the current number of active sessions, those existing sessions continue running and are not terminated.

You can configure the parallel test limit per host in *Settings > Device Lab Management*. Bulk updates can be applied by updating the database (Cloud customers must contact Customer Support).

== Accessibility: iOS VoiceOver support in manual sessions

NOTE: This feature is currently only available for private and local devices. Public devices are not supported.

iOS VoiceOver is now supported in manual sessions, enabling testers to remotely navigate iOS devices using screen reader controls.

This feature helps teams validate accessibility requirements and test VoiceOver behavior during manual testing. By interacting with apps through VoiceOver, testers can uncover accessibility issues that may not be apparent through visual testing alone.

=== Requirements

To use VoiceOver in a manual session, you need:

* A Raspberry Pi host configured as a Bluetooth keyboard
* An iOS device paired with the Raspberry Pi host
* VoiceOver support enabled for manual sessions

=== How it works

When an iOS device is paired with the Raspberry Pi host, a *Screen Reader* option becomes available in manual sessions. From this option, you can turn VoiceOver on or off, navigate the screen using VoiceOver controls, and adjust VoiceOver rotor settings.

A user guide for iOS VoiceOver support will be available soon.

== deviceConnect Console: new menu for Bluetooth pairing

[NOTE]
====

This section applies to the following Bluetooth-based features:

* Audio injection
* iOS VoiceOver

====

A new Bluetooth pairing menu is now available in the *deviceConnect Console*, simplifying how devices are paired with a Raspberry Pi host.

The Bluetooth pairing menu appears under *Settings > Bluetooth Modules* when `BluetoothBridgeService.Enabled` is set to `true` in the `dc.ini` configuration file. With this update, device pairing through the Raspberry Pi command-line interface is no longer supported.

=== Additional notes

Existing audio injection users must flash the latest Bluetooth Bridge audio system image to use the new menu.

For Bluetooth keyboard–based features, note the following during initial pairing:

* After approximately 10 seconds, the device disconnects from the host.
* Reconnect the device to the host to establish a stable connection.

== Bluetooth-related features: important notes & known limitations

[NOTE]
====

This section applies to the following Bluetooth-based features:

* Audio injection
* iOS VoiceOver

====

A Raspberry Pi host supports only one Bluetooth-based function at a time:

* Keyboard mode for VoiceOver on iOS devices
* Audio mode for audio injection for automated or manual testing

Only one mode can be active at a time. If you switch between modes, you must re-flash the Raspberry Pi with the appropriate system image and re-pair the device.

Additional constraints:

* A Raspberry Pi host currently supports one device at a time.
* A single Mac mini host can connect to multiple Raspberry Pi hosts.

== New Subscription Management Permission

A new permission, `subscription.modify_subscription`, allows Admins to manage subscriptions on self-serve plans.

Previously, this capability was limited to Org Owners. This permission is not included in the Admin role by default. To enable it, create a custom role, add the permission, and assign the role to an Admin.

== Scriptless improvements

=== Test Case Management and Session Explorer

* *Session Explorer* now opens in a new tab from *Test Run Details* when viewing session details, making it easier to return to the *Test Run Details* page.
* Fixed missing crash indicator on test steps in *Session Explorer*.
* Fixed issue where screenshots were cut off on tablets during blocker remediation in *Session Explorer*.

=== UI and usability updates

* In *Test Case Details*, remediated test steps are now correctly matched for older test case versions.
* Fixed an issue where test case tags were missing in Test Case and Test Run details when installing certain apps.
* The *Test Run Setup* page now displays only devices that match the test case OS platform.
* Improved scroll-to-find element behavior when scrolling is combined with tab switching.

=== Validations

Enhanced Response Time Validations for Network Payload Capture (NPC), ensuring correct behavior in both manual and automation sessions.

== Automation improvements & fixes

* *Improved error handling:* Display correct error message when invalid kobiton store ID (format: `kobiton-store:v<app_id>`) is used in either API calls or automation scripts.
* *Enhanced device selection*:
** Added capabilities to select devices with specific tags in automation: `kobiton:deviceTags` and `kobiton:deviceTagType`
** *Recommendation:* While `kobiton:tagName` remains supported, we recommend using the new capabilities for greater flexibility, including support for multiple tags.
* *Basic Appium 2 enhancement:* Added support for device log streaming in Basic Appium 2 sessions.
* *Automation protocol update:* The *W3C* protocol (instead of the *JSON Wire* protocol) is now used when specifying Appium capabilities with *capabilities.firstMatch*.

== Kobiton CLI improvements & fixes

* *CLI download from Portal:* Users can now download the Kobiton CLI directly from the Portal. Kobiton CLI can be used with private and local devices.
* Fixed an issue with the *auto-dismiss* alert functionality.
* Resolved an issue where *environment variables* were ignored when launching an app using the kobiton app run command.
* Added a clear error message when a user *cancels a CLI app installation* and then attempts to reinstall it while the previous installation is still in progress.

== General improvements & fixes

* *Upgrade behavior:* Preserved GigaCap user configuration during `dpkg` installs instead of overwriting existing settings.
* *Device tags:* Added support for special characters in device tags: `@`, `.`, `_`, `-`, and `+`.
* *OS support:* Resolved issue with iOS 14 devices that were failing to initialize `deviceControl`.
* *App Repo – delete confirmation:* Improved the delete confirmation message to clearly indicate that app deletions are permanent.
* *API v2 – device tag limits:* Removed the 50-device limit for device tag assignments.
* *App Repo / API v2 – app search:* Added support for searching apps using the `kobiton-store:v<app_id>` format.
* Added support for *UiPath Mobile Device Manager* using either Xium or Basic Appium 2
* *Android app state preservation:* Introduced a `dc.ini` configuration to prevent Android apps from resetting their state when reopened from the background during manual sessions. When set, this setting applies to all devices on the host. To enable this behavior, set `AndroidDeviceController.UseLauncherStyleLaunch=true` (default: `false`).
