== Updates to the Kobiton Platform

=== Accessibility Assertions

To help with testing mobile accessibility functionality, we've added the two assertions to test with:

** Color contrast
** Touch target

=== One-Time Password Bypass

Can't get away from One-Time Passwords, but to make them easier by exporting an Appium script through the portal.

=== Device Health Check

Public devices will display if it's in a healthy state. Hover over to display why the device is unhealthy.

=== Sleep/Wait time added to Data-Driven Testing

To avoid a test to run before a screen renders and is able to run the functionality, wait/sleep time has been added to Data-Driven Testing.

=== Exported Scripts on SauceLabs Devices

When users select a SauceLabs device, by default the script will be run on the SauceLabs device.

=== Figma Integration

Figma's integration provides a screenshot overlay of a Figma design/layout over the app launched on a Kobiton portal device. This integration can serve as a visual comparison directly on the portal that eliminates going back and forth from screen to screen which can often result in details missed on the final product.

=== Search Improvements:

** On the Sessions detail page, search field will populate the most recent search fields.
** The ability to search keyword dynamically has been added to the Kobiton portal.
** Search is available on device logs

=== TestRail Integration Enhancement

Our TestRail integration has gotten a major upgrade by creating an authentication form on the Kobiton UI. Once an admin has completed the authentication process, all users under that adminâ€™s organization will be able to reach their TestRail test cases from the portal.

=== OneLogin

Kobition users will be able to access the OneLogin template on the OneLogin catalog to more easily be able to connect with the security software.

=== UI Improvements

** The sessions list has gone from a pagination layout to infinite scroll.

== DLM Updates

=== Device Tags

Devices can now be tagged through the UI. This allows devices to be grouped, assigned, or easily identified.

=== Improvements

** Devices that are disconnected will still display on the UI.
** Softbooking, by default, is now available to all users on private devices

=== SSO Improvements

** Role mapping is disabled when "Enforce SSO" is enabled
** The SSO button can be enabled when enabling "Role mapping"

=== RBAC Improvements

** Public devices are automatically added to Teams
** Devices can be filtered by "assign" and "unassigned"

=== Bug Fixes

The mapping between the playback panel and system metrics has been corrected to display the proper time.
