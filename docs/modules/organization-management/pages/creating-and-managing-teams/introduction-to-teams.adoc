A Kobiton Team consists of a subsection of users identified as a single group within the Organization. Each Team can assign its own members and devices. Team Admin and Member users have exclusive access to the Team assigned devices and recorded sessions.

*Members* can toggle between the Teams to which they are assigned and will only be able to access devices assigned to those groups.

== Session Access by Role

*Admins* will be able to toggle between all existing Teams and see all recorded sessions on the Sessions page.

*Members* can toggle between the Teams to which they are assigned and will only be able to see recorded sessions from those Teams' devices.
