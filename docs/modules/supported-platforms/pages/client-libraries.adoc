== Kobiton

Kobiton utilizes XIUM, Kobiton's high-speed reimplementation of Appium Server, to support mobile automation. XIUM is designed to be more stable, faster than Appium, and is compatible with multiple versions of Appium, including the most current version. If you experience any issues running your Appium scripts, please reach out to https://support.kobiton.com[Kobiton Support].
