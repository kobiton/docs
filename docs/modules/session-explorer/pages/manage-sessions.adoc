=== View the execution history for tagged sessions

Session Overview includes an Execution History section for sessions with tags, allowing you to see the status, device, and OS information for up to five related sessions.

To view the execution history of tagged sessions:

. Go to *Session Overview* for any tagged session.

. Scroll to the *Execution History* section.

. You’ll see the last five sessions with the same tag, including:

** Session statuses (e.g., passed, failed)

** Device and OS information

** Details like Session ID and Creation Date when hovering over a session

image:session-overview-execution-history.png[width=600,alt="The Execution History by Tag section under Session Overview"]

[NOTE]
If the current session is not one of the five most recent sessions, you’ll see an ellipsis (…) indicating that additional sessions exist but aren’t shown in this view.

Clicking on a tag name in the Execution History section will open the Session List, automatically filtered to show all sessions associated with that tag.
