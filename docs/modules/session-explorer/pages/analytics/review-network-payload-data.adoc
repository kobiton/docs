You'll need to complete a xref:manual-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[manual session,window=read-later] _or_ an xref:automation-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[automation session,window=read-later] with network payload capture enabled.

== Launch Session Explorer
