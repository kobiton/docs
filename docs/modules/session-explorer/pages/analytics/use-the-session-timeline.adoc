=== Action groups in timeline

In the Session Explorer timeline, you can see visually distinct groupings of related Appium commands as xref:automation-testing:scripting/add-action-groups-in-appium-script.adoc[defined in your test script]. Each group created using `'kobiton:stepGroup'` is represented as a labeled section within the timeline, offering clear segmentation of test steps.
