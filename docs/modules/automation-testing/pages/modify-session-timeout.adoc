Learn how to extend your session timeout for unavailable devices

== Try/catch loop

When you run your script and try to connect Kobiton for any device, if that device is not available then you can retry with a try/catch loop from your code. It will keep trying for 15 minutes and then we can check the available device in every 30 sec.

For example:

[source,java]
----
try {
  System.out.println("Creating Driver Test1");
  int cnt=30;
  boolean IsSessionCreated=false;

  while(!IsSessionCreated)
  {
    try {
      driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(kobitonServerUrl), capabilities);
      IsSessionCreated=true;
      }catch(SessionNotCreatedException snce) {
        IsSessionCreated=false;
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(30);

    }
    if (cnt<=0) {
      break;
      }
    cnt--;
}
