----
 'autoWebview': True # Automatically select the webview context.
----

=== `browserName`

Select the *Web* app type to assign a web browser to `browserName` as a `string`. `safari` will be used for iOS and `chrome` will be used for Android.

[source,python]

'browserName': 'safari' # Use Safari for web testing on iOS.
'browserName': 'chrome' # Use Chrome for web testing on Android.
----

=== `app`

Select *Apps* and xref:apps:index.adoc[choose an app] or select *URL* and enter an *Application URL* to assign your app's source to `app` as a `string`.

----

=== useConfiguration
//$COMEBACK$

Choose a configuration from *Configuration* and assign a configuration file to `useConfiguration` as a `string`. By default, no configuration will be used, but you can choose one by selecting any of the configurations you previously created.

[source,python]
----
'useConfiguration': 'kobiton' # Use this pre-defined configuration for the test session.
----

=== `deviceOrientation`

Choose an *Orientation* to assign portrait or landscape to `deviceOrientation` as an integer. This sets the starting orientation for the device in your test session.

[source,python]
----
'deviceOrientation': 'portrait' # Set the device's starting orientation to portrait.
'deviceOrientation': 'landscape' # Set the device's starting orientation to landscape.
----

=== `deviceName`

The current device is automatically assigned to `deviceName` as an `integer`. However, you can manually choose a different device by assigning a specific device to `deviceName` or using wildcards (`*`) to assign multiple.

[source,python]
----
'deviceName': 'iPhone 11 Pro' # Use iPhone 11 Pro as the device name.
'deviceName': '*Pro' # Use any device name ending with 'Pro'.
'deviceName': 'iPhone 11*' # Use any device name starting with 'iPhone 11'.

'platformName': 'Android' # Use the Android platform for the test session.
----

=== `platformVersion`

The current version is automatically assigned to `platformVersion` as an `integer`. However, you can manually choose a different version by assigning a specific version to `platformVersion` or using wildcards (`*`) to assign multiple.

----

[#_manually_added_parameters]
== Manually-added parameters

=== `kobiton:visualValidation`

Set both `"ensureWebviewsHavePages"` and `"kobiton:visualValidation"` to `true`.You can also choose a specific reference session for `visualValidation` by assigning the session's xref:get-kobitonsessionid.adoc[`kobitonSessionId`] to `"kobiton::baselineSessionId"` instead.

Now you can run visual validation scripts on an individual device.If you'd like to run your script in parallel, also xref:_run_in_parallel[modify the `setup()` function].

[source,java]
----
capabilities.setCapability("ensureWebviewsHavePages", true); // Set to true.
capabilities.setCapability("kobiton:visualValidation", true);  // Set to true.
capabilities.setCapability("kobiton:referenceSessionId", 0000011); // (Optional) Choose a different reference session by assigning its kobitonSessionId.
----

=== `kobiton:flexCorrect`

Set `"kobiton:flexCorrect"` to `true`. You can also choose a specific baseline session for `flexCorrect` by assigning the session's xref:get-kobitonsessionid.adoc[`kobitonSessionId`] to `"kobiton::baselineSessionId"` instead.

Now `flexCorrect` will autocorrect element selectors so you can run automation scripts on different devices without getting "Element not found" errors. After your session, you can xref:session-analytics:session-overview.adoc#_number_of_corrections[check how many autocorrections `flexCorrect` made].

[source,java]
----
capabilities.setCapability("kobiton:flexCorrect", true);  // Enable flexCorrect by setting capability to true.
capabilities.setCapability("kobiton:baselineSessionId", 0000011); // (Optional) Choose a different baseline session by assigning its kobitonSessionId.
