:navtitle: Available visual validations

As this feature is still somewhat new and continues to be improved upon with every release, please keep in mind that at this time there are a few limitations:

* A manual session must run and the Appium session exported
* The remediation page will only display in read-only mode
* Support for Kobiton devices only (does not support Sauce Labs devices)

Content and layout support does not include:
* crash
* color text
* WBI
* performance

Content and layout support *does* include text currently, with the use of the desiredCap `kobiton:textValidation`
