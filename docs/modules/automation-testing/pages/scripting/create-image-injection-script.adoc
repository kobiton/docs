:navtitle: Create an image injection script

Learn how to automate the process of image injection, so you can automate your test suite.

== Before you start

Enable image injection for your app with one of these options:

* Instrument your app and use the capability `'kobiton:instrumentenabled'` (Android only) to xref:#appium_instrumentation_capability[instrument your app] .

* Add Kobiton image injection SDK into your Android or iOS apps. Follow xref:apps:image-injection-sdk/add-the-sdk-to-your-android-app.adoc[this guide] for andriod, and xref:apps:image-injection-sdk/add-the-sdk-to-your-ios-app.adoc[this guide] for iOS.

[#appium_instrumentation_capability]
== Appium capability (instrumentation only)

Add the `'kobiton:instrumentenabled'` capability to your scriptâ€™s capabilities list. The value of this capability must be `true` to instrument the app for image injection.


[IMPORTANT]
Only include this Appium capability for image injection via app instrumentation. *Do not* include it for apps with image injection SDK embedded.

== Kobiton commands

To automate the process of image injection, use commands provided by the Kobiton SDK.

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Command | Description | Parameters
| `kobiton:setImage` | Starts the image injection process by injecting a specified image into the camera view. | `data`: A base64 encoded string of the image you want to inject.
| `kobiton:clearImage` |  This command stops the image injection process and reverts the camera view back to the live feed.
 |
|=======================

=== Handle image file and injection

Ensure the image file you intend to inject is stored locally and accessible by the test script.

Pass the image file to the test script using `base64` encoding and include the command to inject it. Below is an example of an `injectImage` function demonstrating this process.

.Example (JavaScript)
[source,javascript]

----

async function injectImage(driver, imagepath) {
  // assume the image is in the same folder as the test script so only need to provide a relative path to the image
  const imagePath = path.join(__dirname, imagepath);

  const base64Image = fs.readFileSync(imagePath, { encoding: 'base64' });

  // the command to set image on the device
  await driver.execute('kobiton:setImage', { data: base64Image });
}

----

=== Start Image Injection

Given that the `injectImage` function was already declared in the previous section, use it to begin the image injection process:

.Example (JavaScript)
[source,javascript]

    await injectImage(driver, 'path_to_image/image.jpg');

This will replace the camera view with the specified file in the relative path `path_to_image/image.jpg`.

=== Stop image injection

To stop image injection use:

.Example (JavaScript)
[source,javascript]

    await driver.execute('kobiton:clearImage');

This will revert the camera view back to the live feed.

== Limitations

* Only supported in Xium automation sessions.

* The image must be located on the runner machine and be passed with `base64` encoding. Passing the image URL is not yet supported.

== Known issues

The Android application with custom SDK crashes when attempting to start the camera services.

*Cause*: The custom SDK utilizes hidden APIs from Android, which may not be turned on and cause the app to crash.

*Solution*: Enable a Cleanup Policy with *Device settings will be reset* option checked. If no Cleanup Policy is enabled, run the following `adb shell` command before launching the app:
