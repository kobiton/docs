:navtitle: Start a mixed session

Learn how to start a mixed session, so you can view your Appium script running on your device and fix issues in realtime.

== What is a mixed session?

A mixed session is where you can use the feature of a manual session to observe what is happening when running an Appium automation script.

It is also possible to perform manual actions on the device in a mixed session to fix unexpected issues during an automation script execution.

== Start the first session

First, choose to start a manual session by xref:devices:search-for-a-device.adoc[launching a device] or an automation session by link:https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/NativeFrameworkAPI/operation/NativeFrameworkAPI_InitiateNativeSession[making a `POST` request].

== Start the second session

After your first session starts, start a second session using the other testing method on the same device. If you started with a manual session, start an automation session. If you started with an automation session, start a manual session.

=== If the first session is manual

Run an Appium or Basic Appium 2 automation script on the device as a manual session is running, using the same user. Once the automation script starts running, a banner on the manual session appears with a message  _Automation Script is running on this device_. Now you can view your script running on the device and fix issues in realtime.

== If the first session is automation

When an automation script is running on the device but has not finished yet, follow one of the following possible methods to start a manual session as the same user that starts the automation session:

* From the Device list: select the Launch button while the device was running automation to enter Session Viewer.

*


== Limitations/Notes

* In a mixed session, both the Manual and Automation session must be initiated by the same user.

* Mixed session are only available for Kobiton 4+ devices.

* Mixed sessions can only be initiated with Appium or Basic Appium 2 automation tests; other automation frameworks, e.g. Espresso, XCUITest, are not currently supported.

* Manual actions in a mixed session is not yet available when a Basic Appium 2 script is running.

* Session Explorer is not available for Mixed Sessions; i.e. it's not possible to view detailed steps and screenshots for Mixed Sessions.

* Mixed sessions cannot be turned into test cases. They cannot be used for our AI functionality: Scriptless, generating Appium Scripts, self-healing.

* When you have a mixed Session on a Public Device, you will be charged minutes for the total time usage on the device; you will not be double-charged for an automation and a manual session.

* A mixed session counts as 1 parallel test session, although it includes a manual and an automation session.
