Learn how to start a mixed session so you can view your Appium script running on your device and fix issues in realtime.

== Start the first session

First, choose to start a manual session by xref:devices:search-for-a-device.adoc[launching a device] or an automation session by link:https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/NativeFrameworkAPI/operation/NativeFrameworkAPI_InitiateNativeSession[making a `POST` request].

== Start the second session

After your first session starts, start a second session using the other testing method on the same device. If you started with a manual session, start an automation session. If you started with an automation session, start a manual session.

== Limitations/Notes

* In a Mixed session, both the Manual and Automation session must be initiated by the same user.

* Mixed session are only available for Kobiton 4+ devices.

* Mixed sessions can only be initiated with Appium automation tests; other automation frameworks, e.g. Espresso, XCUITest, are not currently supported.

* Session Explorer is not available for Mixed Sessions; i.e. it's not possible to view detailed steps and screenshots for Mixed Sessions.

* Mixed sessions cannot be turned into test cases. They cannot be used for our AI functionality: Scriptless, generating Appium Scripts, self-healing.

* When you have a Mixed Session on a Public Device, you will be charged minutes for the total time usage on the device; you will not be double-charged for an automation and a manual session.
