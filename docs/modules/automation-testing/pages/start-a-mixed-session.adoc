:navtitle: Start a mixed session

Learn how to start a mixed session so you can view your Appium script running on your device and fix issues in realtime.

== Start the first session

First, choose to start a manual session by xref:devices:search-for-a-device.adoc[launching a device] or an automation session by link:https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/NativeFrameworkAPI/operation/NativeFrameworkAPI_InitiateNativeSession[making a `POST` request].

== Start the second session

After your first session starts, start a second session using the other testing method on the same device. If you started with a manual session, start an automation session. If you started with an automation session, start a manual session.

== Join your mixed session

Once your first and second sessions are running simultaneously on the same device, you're ready to join your mixed session. In Kobiton, open *Sessions*, look for the session marked *Mixed*, and launch the session.
