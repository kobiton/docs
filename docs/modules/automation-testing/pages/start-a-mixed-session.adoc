:navtitle: Start a mixed session

Learn how to start a mixed session, so you can view your Appium script running on your device and fix issues in realtime.

== What is a mixed session?

A mixed session allows you to observe what occurs during the execution of an Appium automation script through a manual session.

It is also possible to perform manual actions on the device in a mixed session to fix unexpected issues during an automation script execution.

== Start the first session

First, choose to start a manual session by xref:devices:search-for-a-device.adoc[launching a device] or an automation session.

== Start the second session

After your first session starts, start a second session using the other testing method on the same device. If you started with a manual session, start an automation session. If you started with an automation session, start a manual session.

=== If the first session is manual

Run an Appium or Basic Appium 2 automation script on the device as a manual session is running, using the same user. Once the automation script starts running, a banner on the manual session appears with a message  _Automation Script is running on this device_. Now you can view your script running on the device and fix issues in realtime.

=== If the first session is automation

Make sure you are logged in as the same user that started the automation session.

Follow one of the following possible methods to start a manual session in an ongoing automation session:

* From the *Device list*, select the *Launch* button while the device is running automation to enter the mixed session:

* Open the *Session Overview* page of the session, then select the *Session Viewer* button:

* In the session list, highlight the ongoing automation session (by clicking the session name) then choose *Session Viewer* on the action menu:

+

* Alternatively, in the session list, right-click the session, and select *Session Viewer*:

+

Now you can view your script running on the device and fix issues in realtime.

== Limitations/Notes

* In a mixed session, both the Manual and Automation session must be initiated by the same user.

* Mixed sessions can only be initiated with Appium or basic Appium 2 automation tests; other automation frameworks, e.g. Espresso, XCUITest, are not currently supported.

include::automation-testing:partial$mixed-sessions-basic-appium-limitations.adoc[]

* Session Explorer is not available for Mixed Sessions; i.e. it's not possible to view detailed steps and screenshots for Mixed Sessions.

* Mixed sessions cannot be turned into test cases. They cannot be used for our AI functionality: Scriptless, generating Appium Scripts, self-healing.

* When you have a mixed Session on a Public Device, you will be charged minutes for the total time usage on the device; you will not be double-charged for an automation and a manual session.

* A mixed session counts as 1 parallel test session, even though it includes both a manual and an automation session.
