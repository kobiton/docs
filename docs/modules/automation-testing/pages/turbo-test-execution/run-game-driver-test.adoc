:navtitle: Run a GameDriver test

[NOTE]
====
This feature is currently in Beta and is limited to Android devices.
====

Learn how to run https://gamedriver.io/[GameDriver] tests on real devices using the Turbo Test Execution feature of the Kobiton Platform. Turbo Test Execution enables mobile automation tests to run on the same network as a real device for optimal execution speed and low latency.

== Prerequisites

* A Kobiton subscription that includes GameDriver Turbo Test Execution.
* An Android app built with https://unity.com/[Unity] with a GameDriver agent already embedded. Learn how to do it https://support.gamedriver.io/support/solutions/articles/69000368474-installation-instructions[here].
* A GameDriver test project for apps built with Unity. Learn how to create one https://support.gamedriver.io/support/solutions/articles/69000388800-testing-android-apps-built-with-unity[here].

== Prepare the test project package

To run GameDriver tests on the Kobiton platform, expose the `testPort` environment variable in your test script like the example below:

image:automation-testing:gamedriver-expose-testport.png[width="1000",alt="Expose testPort environment variable in test script"]

Then, package the test project for local execution. After running your tests against the Unity editor to verify they are functioning as expected, copy the `<Test>/bin/Debug` directory contents of your test into your Appium `<Test>/test` folder. For example:

image:automation-testing:gamedriver-test-package.png[width="500",alt="Package your test project for local execution"]

Copy the `<Test>/packages/NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.12.0/tools` directory contents to your `<Test>/ext` folder.

Archive the `<Test>` folder into a .zip file, such as _test_runner.zip_.

== Obtain Kobiton API credentials

Log in to the Kobiton Portal using your Kobiton username/email and password.

Select the profile picture, then navigate to *Settings*.

image:profile:choose-settings-context.png[width="1000",alt="Navigate to Settings in Kobiton Portal"]

In the API Keys page, note down the *Server URL* but remove `/wd/hub`. For example, if the Server URL is `\https://api.kobiton.com/wd/hub`, then only note down `\https://api.kobiton.com`. This is the `<api base url>` to be used later.

Next, note down the value of one of the API Keys. This value, together with the Kobiton account’s username/email, is required to obtain the `<credentials>` to be used later. Add a new key if there aren't any.

== Prepare and collect information from Kobiton

Before you can run the test on Kobiton devices, you need to prepare and collect information from Kobiton. This can be completed by either of these 2 methods:

=== Method 1: Using Kobiton Portal

Log in to the Kobiton Portal using your Kobiton username/email and password.

Navigate to the application repository by selecting *Apps* on the navigation pane.

Select the *+* icon to upload an app.

image:apps:select-apps-context.png[width="1000",alt="Select the plus icon to upload an app""]

Wait until the below _File uploaded successfully..._ message appears.

image:apps:app-upload-success.png[width="1000",alt="File uploaded successfully message"]

Refresh the page until the message is replaced by your app icon. See below for an example. Then, select the newly uploaded app.

image:apps:open-uploaded-app.png[width="1000",alt="Open the uploaded app"]

Make sure the screen displays the app version as below, then select the *Automation Snippet* icon.

image:automation-testing:app-automation-snippet.png[width="1000",alt="Select Automation Snippet"]

Note down the value in the text field. This is the `<app url>` to be used later.

image:automation-testing:app-automation-snippet-value.png[width="500",alt="Note down automation snippet value"]

Navigate to the Device list by selecting *Devices* on the navigation pane.

Select the 3-dot icon on the Android device you plan to use for testing.

image:automation-testing:open-device-overview-context.png[width="1000",alt="Navigate to Devices and select the 3-dot icon on an Android device"]

Note down the device’s UDID. This is the `<udid>` to be used later. Select *Automation Settings*.

image:automation-testing:device-overview-closeup.png[width="1000",alt="Note down the device UDID, then select Automation Settings"]

In the Framework dropdown, select *UIAutomator/ Espresso*.

image:automation-testing:automation-framework-uiautomator-espresso.png[width="1000",alt="Select UIAutomator or Espresso"]

Scroll down until you find the Test Runner section, then select *Upload Test Runner*.

image:automation-testing:upload-test-runner.png[width="1000",alt="Select Upload Test Runner under the Test Runner section"]

Choose the _test_runner.zip_ file and select *Open*.

When the file finishes uploading, note down the value of *Test Runner Url*. This is the `<test runner url>` to be used later.

image:automation-testing:test-runner-url.png[width="500",alt="Note down the value of Test Runner URL"]

=== Method 2: Using Kobiton API

Run the following API endpoints in order to upload an app to the Kobiton application repository:

* https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/ApplicationAPI/operation/ApplicationAPI_GenerateUploadUrl[Generate application upload URL]
* https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/ApplicationAPI/operation/CustomAPIv2_ApplicationAPI_UploadFileToS3[Upload file to S3]
* https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/ApplicationAPI/operation/ApplicationAPI_CreateAppAndVersion[Create application or application version]

Append the `version_id` from the response of the last endpoint to the text below. This is the `<app url>` to be used later.

----
kobiton-store:v<version_id>
----

Run the following API endpoints, in order, to upload the test runner to Kobiton:

* https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/NativeFrameworkAPI/operation/NativeFrameworkAPI_GetTestRunnerUploadUrl[Get test runner upload URL]
* https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/ApplicationAPI/operation/CustomAPIv2_ApplicationAPI_UploadFileToS3[Upload file to S3]
* https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs#tag/NativeFrameworkAPI/operation/NativeFrameworkAPI_GetTestRunnerUploadUrl[Get test runner download URL]

Note down the value of `url` from the response of the last endpoint. This is the `<test runner url>` to be used later.

Run the List all devices API endpoint to find an Android device to use for your testing. Note down the value of `udid` in the response of the desired device. This is the `<udid>` to be used later.

== Run the automation test

Open a terminal in your computer and enter the following command:

[source,commandline]
----
curl --location '<api base url>/v2/sessions/native' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <credentials>' \
--data '{
    "session_description": "<session description>",
    "session_name": "<session name>",
    "test_framework": "GAMEDRIVER",
    "app": "<app url>",
    "run_command": "mono <path to nunit runner> <path to test script> --testparam:Mode=standalone --testparam:testHost=localhost --testparam:testPort=<gdio port>",
    "test_runner": "<test runner url>",
    "root_directory": "<root directory name>",
    "udid": "<udid>",
    "device_name": "<device name>",
    "platform_version": "<device OS version>"
