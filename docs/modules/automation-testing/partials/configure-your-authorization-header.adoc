// == Configure your authorization header

To ensure your credentials are kept secure, all requests sent to `\https://api.kobiton.com/` must contain link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617#section-2[an Authentication header]. Credentials assigned to your authorization header need to be in base64 format.

In your terminal, convert xref:_before_you_start[your Kobiton API credentials] to base64 format using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
echo -n "${yourUserNameOrEmail}:${yourApiKey}" | base64
----

Copy the generated string and save it in a secure location for later.
