* Network Payload Capture is not supported on Espresso and XCUITest automation sessions.

* NPC is not supported capturing network on domains with an SSL self-signed certificate.

* Certificate pinning prevents network payload capture. If you want to capture payload for native application, make sure to disable certificate pinning in your app.

* All iOS devices cannot access any Apple domains (including App Store) in an NPC session.

* A custom configuration profile is needed to enable the HTTP Proxy on iOS devices. Therefore, NPC does not work if there is another HTTP Proxy configuration profile installed on the device.

* If iOS devices from a Mac mini hosts are supervised by many supervision identity (organizations), only 1 supervision identity can work with NPC (the identity imported into the Mac mini host).
