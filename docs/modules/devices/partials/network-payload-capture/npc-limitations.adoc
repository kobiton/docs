* Network Payload Capture is not supported on Espresso and XCUITest automation sessions.

* NPC does not support capturing network traffic on domains that use a self-signed SSL certificate.

* Certificate pinning prevents network payload capture. If you want to capture payload for a native application, make sure to disable certificate pinning in your app.

* iOS devices cannot access any Apple domains (including App Store) in an NPC session.

* A custom configuration profile is needed to enable the HTTP Proxy on iOS devices. Therefore, NPC does not work if there is another HTTP Proxy configuration profile installed on the device.

* If iOS devices hosted on a Mac mini are supervised by multiple supervision identities (organizations), only one supervision identity—the one imported into the Mac mini host—will work with NPC.
