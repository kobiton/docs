Safely disconnect the device from your computer. In terminal, open the directory for the xref:_get_device_udid[device UDID you copied earlier] using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/Kobiton/devices/<device-udid>
----

For example:

[source,shell]
----
cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/Kobiton/devices/a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2
----

In the device UDID directory, create a file named `config` and add the following content:

[source,plaintext]
----
{
  "unlockPasscodeEnabled": false,
  "networkPayloadCaptureEnabled": true
}
----

When you're finished, save your changes. Now you can use network payload capture during a xref:manual-testing:enable-network-payload-capture.adoc[manual session] or xref:automation-testing:enable-network-payload-capture.adoc[automation session].
