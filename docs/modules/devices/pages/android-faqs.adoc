== How can I bypass the black screen when logging into Google Play Store (device with passcode)?

On passcode-enabled devices, during a manual session, the screen turns black when logging into Google Play. The black screen is actually the passcode input screen.

Copy the passcode in the top session bar.

Open *adb shell* terminal in the device action.

Type `input text <passcode>` (replace `<passcode>` with the copied passcode) and hit *Enter*.

Type `input keyevent 66` and hit *Enter*.

The black screen disappears and the user can view the screen again.

== How do I resolve the black screen issue when testing a secure app that blocks screen capture (FLAG_SECURE)?
