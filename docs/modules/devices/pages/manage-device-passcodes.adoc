:navtitle: Manage device passcodes

Some apps or MDMs require a passcode to be set on a device. So in order to test them, Kobiton must support the ability to add a passcode to a device. The device passcode feature is available for Private and Local devices.

== Set custom passcode

Admins can choose which devices require a passcode and which don't by choosing the passcode toggle in each device modal. For devices where a passcode is required, a user will be asked to set a passcode upon launching a session or enter a passcode if it is already set.

== Set auto-generated passcode or PIN

As mentioned above, the PIN and PASSWORD passcode mode must be activated for you by the Kobiton team. Once the device is enabled with pin or passcode, you will launch the device from the Portal without the need to enter the the passcode. When in a manual session, you can check the device passcode by turning off the screen and turning it on again. By doing this, you'll see the device *automatically* filling in the passcode and unlocking the device.

* *PASSWORD mode:* all devices are automatically set with system-generated alphabetic text passcode. Users will not see the passcode when interacting with the device and there will not be a passcode toggle button in the device modal.

* *PIN mode:* all devices are automatically set with system-generated PIN number passcode. Users will not see the passcode when interacting with the device and there will not be a passcode toggle button in the device modal.
