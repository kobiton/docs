== Understanding Mobile Device Management Systems

Mobile Device Management systems, or MDMs, act as digital gatekeepers. Their primary function is to control, secure, and enforce policies on mobile devices within an organization. A common practice is for MDMs to necessitate device passcodes, providing a potent safeguard against unauthorized access.

== The Role of MDMs in Mobile Testing

While MDMs are beneficial, they complicate mobile testing, introducing an additional layer of security that must be accounted for in your test scripts. Worse, if you're unable to enable passcodes on your mobile devices, testing becomes impossible.

== Our Solution

We provide device passcodes for private and local devices so you can write and run tests that meet MDM requirements. When you xref:manual-testing:start-a-manual-session.adoc[start a manual session] or xref:manual-testing:device-controls.adoc#_power[restart your device] during a session, the passcodes are automatically inputted for you.
