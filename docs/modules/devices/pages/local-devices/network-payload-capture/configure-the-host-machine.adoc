= Configure the Mac mini host for network payload capture
:navtitle: Configure Mac mini host

Learn how to configure your local Cloud or Standalone Kobiton Mac mini host so you and your team can use network payload capture (NPC) during a xref:manual-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[manual session] or xref:automation-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[automation session].

[#_before_you_start]
== Before you start

You'll need to:

* Access the Mac mini host as the *deviceconnect* user for all the operations below.
* For iOS devices, decide which option to use for setting up the iOS devices.
* Make sure the Mac mini is connected to a network that satisfies the network requirements for Network Payload Capture before proceeding.

== Mac mini with Apple Silicon: Install Rosetta

[NOTE]
This section is only required for Mac mini host with Apple Silicon.

Open *Terminal* on the Mac mini host.

Run the below command to install Rosetta:

[source,shell]
softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license

== Modify the `dc.ini` file

Edit the `dc.ini` file from the location `/usr/local/deviceconnect/` using any text editor (Create a backup of the `dc.ini` file prior to making updates).

Check if the below content exists in the file. Otherwise, append the content to the end of the file.

[IMPORTANT]

Make sure the below is under the `[set]` tag, not `[config]`.

[source,plaintext]
----
# Payload Capture
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyHost=[deviceConnect IP address]
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyIsLocal=true
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyControlPort=8225
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyHttpListenPort=8080
DeviceNetworkCapture.TimeoutConnectSeconds=10
DeviceNetworkCapture.Trace=true
DeviceNetworkCapture.ExternalDebugLog=false
----

Replace `[deviceConnect IP address]` with the local IP address of the Mac mini host.

[NOTE]
If the Mac mini is connected to more than one networks at the same time (for example, both Ethernet and Wi-Fi), make sure `[deviceconnect IP address]` is the IP address obtained from the interface that is connected to the same network as the mobile devices.

You can retrieve the local IP address(es) of the Mac mini by either:

* Navigating to *Settings > Network > Ethernet* or *Wi-Fi* and copying the IP address value. For Wi-Fi, click the *Detailsâ€¦* button next to the connected network to view the IP.

* Opening *Terminal*, then entering the `ifconfig` command. The IP address is usually under the `en0` entry (for Etheret) or `en1` entry (for Wi-Fi), next to `inet`.

----

Save the file, then xref:device-lab-management:deviceConnect/restart-deviceconnect-services.adoc[restart services] on the Mac mini host to apply the changes.

If you are only hosting Android devices, you can move on to configure your xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-android-device.adoc[Android device]. The next sections are only required for hosting iOS devices.

---

include::partial$network-payload-capture/npc-ios-options.adoc[]

Based on the decided option, prepare the device using either option 1 or 2.

== Option 1: Check the supervision identity and dc.ini configuration

Access the Mac mini host and open *Finder*.

Hold *Shift + Command + G* on the keyboard, then input the following path: `/usr/local/deviceconnect` and hit *Enter*.

In the above location, if there are 2 files `organization.crt` and `organization.der`, then the supervision identity already exists.

If the 2 files do not exist, follow [this guide] to create and/or export the supervision identity files on a Mac machine that is not running Kobiton software, then transfer them to the Mac mini host.

Edit the `dc.ini` file from the location `/usr/local/deviceconnect/` using any text editor (Create a backup of the `dc.ini` file prior to making updates).

Find the line `IOSDeviceController.WifiCaptureProxyAutomation=ui` in the content of the file.

* If there is no such line, move on to the xref:next_steps[next steps].

* If there is such a line, change it to the following: `IOSDeviceController.WifiCaptureProxyAutomation=profile`. Restart deviceConnect services to apply the changes.

== Option 2: Establish trusted ssh connection and install Automation Tools

Access the Mac mini host.

[#_check_for_an_existing_ssh_key]
=== Check for an existing SSH key

In the terminal, open the `.ssh` directory, then list the contents of the directory.

[source,shell]
----
cd ~/.ssh && ls -a
----

If you see an `id_rsa` file, go to xref:_modify_the_ssh_key[]. Otherwise, continue to the next section.

[#_generate_a_new_ssh_key]
=== Generate a new SSH key

In the `.ssh` directory, enter the following command:

[source,shell]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

Leave the passphrase empty and press *Enter*.

[source,shell]
----
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave empty]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Leave empty]
----

Now you're ready to xref:_modify_the_ssh_key[modify the SSH key].

[#_modify_the_ssh_key]
=== Modify the SSH key

In the `.ssh` directory, copy the contents from your `id_rsa` public key into the `authorized_keys` file.

[source,shell]
----
cat id_rsa.pub >> ./authorized_keys
----

[NOTE]
If an `authorized_keys` file doesn't exist, one will be automatically created.

Login using your SSH key. If prompted to _trust this connection_, type *yes* and press *Enter*.

[source,shell]
----
ssh 127.0.0.1
----

After you're successfully logged in, exit the SSH session, then restart the Mac mini host.

[source,shell]
----
exit && sudo shutdown -r now
----

== Install Automation Tools from Apple Configurator

Access the Mac mini host after it restarts.

Open the *App Store*, search for and install *Apple Configurator*.

image:apple-configurator-mac-app-store.png[width=800,alt="Apple Configurator in the Mac App Store"]

[NOTE]
An Apple ID is required to download and install Apple Configurator.

Open *Apple Configurator*. On the menu bar, select *Apple Configurator*, then *Install Automation Tools*.

image:apple-configurator-menu-install-automation-tools.png[width=400,alt="The Install Automation Tools option under the Apple Configurator menu bar"]

A pop-up appears, select *Install* and provide the administrator password to continue.

image:apple-configurator-install-automation-tools-popup.png[width=300,alt="The Install Automation Tools confirmation pop-up"]

Once the automation tools are installed, close Apple Configurator since it doesn't need to be open for network payload capture.

=== Add dc.ini configuration

Edit the `dc.ini` file from the location `/usr/local/deviceconnect/` using any text editor (Create a backup of the `dc.ini` file prior to making updates).

Find the line starting with `IOSDeviceController.WifiCaptureProxyAutomation` in the content of the file.

* If there is no such line, add this line to the end of the file:

+

[source]
IOSDeviceController.WifiCaptureProxyAutomation=ui

* If the line exists, ensure the line matches exactly `IOSDeviceController.WifiCaptureProxyAutomation=ui`. Update the line if it does not match.

Restart deviceConnect services to apply the changes.

[#next_steps]
== Next steps

Configure the xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-android-device.adoc[Android] and xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-ios-device.adoc[iOS devices] for network payload capture.
