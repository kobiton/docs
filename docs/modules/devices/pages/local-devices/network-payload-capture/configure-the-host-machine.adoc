= Configure the Mac mini host for network payload capture
:navtitle: Configure Mac mini host

Learn how to configure your local Cloud or Standalone Kobiton Mac mini host so you and your team can use network payload capture during a xref:manual-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[manual session] or xref:automation-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[automation session].

[#_before_you_start]
== Before you start

You'll need to:

* Access the Mac mini host as the *deviceconnect* user for all the operations below.
* Make sure the Mac mini is connected to a network that satisfies the network requirements for Network Payload Capture before proceeding.

== Modify the `dc.ini` file



Edit the `dc.ini` file from the location `/usr/local/deviceconnect/` using any text editor (Create a backup of the `dc.ini` file prior to making updates).

Check if the below content exists in the file. Otherwise, append the content to the end of the file.

[IMPORTANT]

Make sure the below is under the `[set]` tag, not `[config]`.

# Payload Capture
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyHost=[deviceConnect IP address]
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyIsLocal=true
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyControlPort=8225
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyHttpListenPort=8080
DeviceNetworkCapture.TimeoutConnectSeconds=10
DeviceNetworkCapture.Trace=true
DeviceNetworkCapture.ExternalDebugLog=false
----

Replace `[deviceConnect IP address]` with the local IP address of the Mac mini host. You can retrieve the local IP address of the Mac mini by either:

* Navigating to *Settings > Network > Ethernet* or *Wi-Fi* and copying the IP address value. For Wi-Fi, click the *Detailsâ€¦* button next to the connected network to view the IP.

* Opening *Terminal*, then entering the `ifconfig` command. The IP address is usually under the `e `en0` entry (for Etheret) or `en1` entry (for Wi-Fi), next to `inet`.

	inet 192.168.50.118 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.50.255

[NOTE]
If the Mac mini is connected to more than 1 network at the same time (for example, both Ethernet and Wi-Fi), make sure `[deviceconnect IP address]` is the IP address obtained from the interface that is connected to the same network as the mobile devices.

Save the file, then xref:device-lab-management:deviceConnect/restart-deviceconnect-services.adoc[restart services] on the Mac mini host to apply the changes.

If you are only hosting Android devices, you can move on to configure your xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-android-device.adoc[Android device] now. The next section are only required for iOS devices.

== Copy supervision identity

Follow this guide to xref:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-ios-device.adoc#_create_an_organization_then_export_the_supervision_identity[export the supervision identity] from the Mac machine not running Kobiton software. There should be 2 exported files after the process: `organization.crt` and `organization.der`.

Open *Finder*, copy the 2 files above, then enter *Shift + Command + G* on the keyboard and input the following location: `/usr/local/deviceconnect`.

Paste the 2 files into the folder. The result in Finder should look similar to the below:

The Mac mini host setup steps for iOS are now complete. Now, you can configure an xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-ios-device.adoc[iOS device] for network payload capture.

== Next steps

Configure the xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-android-device.adoc[Android] and xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-ios-device.adoc[iOS devices].
