= Configure the local server for network payload capture
:navtitle: Configure the local server

Learn how to configure your local Cloud or Standalone Kobiton server so you and your team can use network payload capture during a xref:manual-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[manual session] or xref:automation-testing:local-devices/capture-network-payload-data.adoc[automation session].

[#_before_you_start]
== Before you start

You'll need to:

* Verify your system administrator privileges for the local Cloud or Standalone Kobiton server.
* Download and install link:https://apps.apple.com/app/id1037126344[Apple Configurator] on the server.

[#_get_the_local_server_ip_address]
== Get the local server IP address

You can use the `ifoncifg` command to get your server's IP address from `en0`. Open the terminal, the use the following command to copy the IP address to your clipboard using the following command. Save this value in a secure location for later.

[source,bash]
----
ifconfig en0 | grep ether | awk '{print $2}' | pbcopy
----

== Modify the `dc.ini` file

Next, you'll edit the `dc.ini` within the `deviceconnect` directory. Open the file in your preferred text editor.

.Example
[source,shell]
----
nano ~/usr/local/deviceconnect/dc.ini
----

If the following lines are present, simply verify the IP address, then go to xref:_check_for_an_existing_ssh_key[]. Otherwise, add these lines to the end of the file and replace `LOCAL_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` with the correct value.

[source,plaintext]
----
# Payload Capture
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyHost=LOCAL_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyIsLocal=true
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyControlPort=8225
DeviceNetworkCapture.NetworkCaptureProxyHttpListenPort=8080
DeviceNetworkCapture.TimeoutConnectSeconds=10
DeviceNetworkCapture.Trace=true
DeviceNetworkCapture.ExternalDebugLog=false
----

When you're finished, save your changes, then run the following command to restart deviceConnect.

[source,shell]
----
sudo sv restart /usr/local/var/service/*
----

[#_check_for_an_existing_ssh_key]
== Check for an existing SSH key

In the terminal, open the `.ssh` directory, then list the contents of the directory.

[source,shell]
----
cd ~/.ssh && ls -a
----

If you see an `id_rsa` file, go to xref:_modify_the_ssh_key[]. Otherwise, continue to the next section.

[#_generate_a_new_ssh_key]
== Generate a new SSH key

In the `.ssh` directory, enter the following command:

[source,shell]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

Leave the passphrase empty and press *Enter*.

[source,shell]
----
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave empty]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Leave empty]
----

Now you're ready to xref:_modify_the_ssh_key[modify the SSH key].

[#_modify_the_ssh_key]
== Modify the SSH key

In the `.ssh` directory, copy the contents from your `id_rsa` public key into the `authorized_keys_` file.

[source,shell]
----
cat id_rsa.pub >> ./authorized_keys
----

[NOTE]
If an `authorized_keys_` file doesn't exist, one will be automatically created.

Login using your SSH key. If prompted to _trust this connection_, type *yes* and press *Enter*.

[source,shell]
----
ssh 127.0.0.1
----

After you're successfully logged in, exit the SSH session, then restart the macMini.

[source,shell]
----
exit && sudo shutdown -r now
----

== Set up Apple Configurator

Open the Apple Configurator app you xref:_before_you_start[installed previously].

image:$NEW$[width="",alt=""]

In the menu bar, select *Apple Configurator 2*, then select *Install Automation Tools*:

image:devices:apple-configurator-install-automation-tools.png[width="", alt=""]

Select *Install*, then enter your admin password. Once the automation tools are installed, you can close Apple Configurator since it doesn't need to be open for network payload capture.

image:$NEW$[width="",alt=""]

Now, you can configure your xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-android-device.adoc[Android device] or xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-an-ios-device.adoc[iOS device] for network payload capture.
