:navtitle: Configure an iOS device

Learn how to configure an iOS device for network payload capture (NPC).

[NOTE]
You'll need to configure each iOS device you want to use for network payload capture.

== Before you start

You'll need to:

* Make sure that the current deviceConnect version on the Mac mini hosting the device is at least *4.18*. xref:device-lab-management:deviceConnect/remote-update-deviceconnect.adoc[Update deviceConnect] if the version is lower.

* Confirm your system administrator xref:devices:local-devices/network-payload-capture/configure-the-host-machine.adoc[configured your local Kobiton server].

* Have access to a Mac machine that *is not* running Kobiton software including _deviceConnect_ or _deviceShare_. This machine will be used to supervise iOS devices.

== Install Apple Configurator and automation tools

Access the Mac machine that *is not* running Kobiton software.

Open the *App Store*, search for and install *Apple Configurator*.

[NOTE]
An Apple ID is required to download and install Apple Configurator.

Open *Apple Configurator*. On the menu bar, select *Apple Configurator*, then *Install Automation Tools*.

A pop-up appears, select *Install* and provide the administrator password to continue.

== Create an organization, then export the supervision identity

On the *Apple Configurator* menu, select *Settings*.

image:apple-configurator-menu-settings.png[width=400,alt="The Settings option under the Apple Configurator menu bar"]

Select the *Organizations* tab. Select the *Plus* sign to add a new organization.

image:apple-configurator-organizations-settings.png[width=500,alt="The Organizations tab under Apple Configurator Settings"]

Select *Next* and log in using the Apple Business or School Manager account. If you do not have such an account, select *Skip*. The next step assumes that you have selected the *Skip* button.

image:apple-configurator-sign-in-apple-manager.png[width=500,alt="The Sign in to Apple School or Apple Business Managager screen with the field to input Apple ID and the Skip button"]

Enter your organization’s information in the below screen and choose *Next*.

image:apple-configurator-create-organization.png[width=500,alt="The form to input the organization details with the Next button"]

Choose *Generate a new supervision identity* and select *Done*.

image:apple-configurator-choose-supervision-identity.png[width=500,alt="Choose Generate a new supervision identity option and select Done"]

Input the administrator password in the pop-up and select *Update Settings*.

Your organization should now appear in the list. Highlight it, then click the *three-dot icon* and select *Export Supervision Identity*.

image:apple-configurator-organizations-actions.png[width=500,alt="The newly created organization under the list with the menu expanded and the Export Supervision Identity option visible"]

In the export supervision identity pop-up:

* Select a location to save the exported files.

* Select *Unencrypted DER …* for *Format*.

* Select *Save*, then *Export*.

image:apple-configurator-export-organization-options.png[width=500,alt="The Export Supervision Identity pop-up with the Unencrypted DER select for Format"]

Under the selected location, there is now a `.crt` and a `.der` file with the same name. Rename those files to `organization.crt` and `organization.der`, in that order. Transfer these 2 files into the Mac mini host (the Mac mini with Kobiton software running).

On the Mac mini host, open *Finder*, copy the 2 files above, then enter *Shift + Command + G* on the keyboard and input the following location: `/usr/local/deviceconnect`.

Paste the 2 files into the folder. The result in Finder should look similar to the below:

== Supervise the device

[WARNING]
====

During this process:

* The device will be unplugged from the Mac mini host to be supervised.

* The device's data will be erased. Back up the device data before proceeding (if needed).


====

Locate the iOS/iPadOS device to set up NPC.

Disconnect the device from the Mac mini host.

Open *Settings* on the device and sign out of any Apple ID. A signed in Apple ID will prevent the supervision of the device.

Connect the iOS device to the Mac machine that is not running Kobiton software and has all steps from the previous section performed on it. Tap *Trust* on the device.

image:device-lab-management:device-lab-management-ios-add-ios-trust-this-computer-trust.PNG[width=300,alt="The Trust this computer prompt on the iOS device screen"]

Open *Apple Configurator* on the Mac machine.

In the main screen of Apple Configurator, select the *Supervised* and the *Unsupervised* tabs to check where the device appears.

If the device is under the *Supervised* tab, then it is already supervised. Right-click the device and select *Get info*.

image:apple-configurator-supervised-device-get-info.png[width=700,alt="The device under the Supervised tab with the Get Info option"]

Double-check the Organization that supervises the device:

* If it is the same organization that you created, skip supervising the device.

* If it is not the same organization, double-check with your team that you can erase and re-supervise it. If yes, https://support.apple.com/en-vn/guide/apple-configurator-mac/cad8cb745a89/2.17/mac/14.0[erase the device], then follow the steps for an unsupervised device.

If the device is under the *Unsupervised* tab, right-click the device and select *Prepare*.

image:apple-configurator-prepare-device-menu.png[width=700,alt="The prepare option after right-clicking the device in Apple Configurator"]

Select *Manual Configuration* for *Prepare with*, check *Supervise devices*, then choose *Next*.

image:apple-configurator-prepare-with.png[width=500,alt="The prepare devices screen with the Manual Configuration selected and Supervise devices checked"]

Select *Do not enroll in MDM*, then *Next*.

image:apple-configurator-enroll-mdm.png[width=500,alt="The Enroll in MDM Server screen with Do not enroll in MDM selected"]

Choose your organization in *Organization*, then select *Next*.

image:apple-configurator-assign-organization.png[width=500,alt="The Assign to Organization screen with the created Organization selected"]

Select *Don’t show any of these steps* for *Setup Assistant*, then *Prepare*.

image:apple-configurator-configure-setup-assistant.png[width=500,alt="The Configure iOS Setup Assistant screen with Don't show any of these steps selected"]

If there is a *Configurator could not perform the requested action…* pop-up, select *Erase*.

image:apple-configurator-erase-device.png[width=300,alt="The Configurator could not perform the selected action pop-up with the Erase button"]

The device will be factory reset. When you can access the device, follow the on-screen prompts until you are at the Home screen.

At this time, the device should be under the *Supervised* tab. Right-click the device and select *Get info*, then double-check the Organization that supervises the device.

Now, xref:device-lab-management:ios-devices/prepare-ios-device.adoc[prepare] and xref:device-lab-management:ios-devices/add-ios-device.adoc[connect] the device into the Mac mini host. See the linked guides for instructions.

The device is now ready for Network Payload Capture.
