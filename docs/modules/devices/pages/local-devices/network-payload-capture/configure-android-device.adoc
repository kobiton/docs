= Configure Android device for network payload capture
:navtitle: Configure Android device

Learn how to configure network payload capture for Android devices so you and your team can use network payload capture during a xref:manual-testing:enable-network-payload-capture.adoc[manual session] or xref:automation-testing:enable-network-payload-capture.adoc[automation session].

[NOTE]
You'll need to configure each Android device you want to use for network playload capture.

== Choose MIME types

[#_get_device_udid]
== Get device UDID

Connect the Android device to your personal computer, then enter the following command to get the device UDID:

[source,shell]
----
adb shell settings get secure android_id
----

You'll need this later. Copy it to a secure location.

== Add certificate to device

Confirm the location of the xref:_before_you_start[certificate you downloaded earlier], then enter the following command:

[source,shell]
----
adb push <path/to/certificate> sdcard
----

For example:

.MacOS
[source,shell]
----
adb push ~/Downloads/mitmproxy-cert.crt sdcard
----

.Windows
[source,shell]
----
adb push C:\Users\Alex\Downloads\mitmproxy-cert.crt sdcard
----

== Install certificate

=== Android 11 or later

On the Android device, open *Settings*, *Biometrics and security*, then *Other security settings*.
