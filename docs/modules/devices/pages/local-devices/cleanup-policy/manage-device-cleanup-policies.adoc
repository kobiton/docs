:navtitle: Manage device cleanup policies

A cleanup policy is a set of steps that are performed on a device when a session ends to remove test data and changes in device settings in the session.

Learn about device cleanup policies management, including creating, editing, removing and assigning to teams or the organization.

== About the predefined cleanup policies

At the Cleanup Policies page, there are 2 predefined cleanup policies:

* *Thorough*: This cleanup policy is equivalent to a user-created policy that has all configurations checked, and performs the most thorough cleanup on a device.

* *No Cleanup*: This cleanup policy does not perform any cleanup on a device. It is *not* equivalent to a user-created policy without any checked item, as there are still some cleanup configurations enabled for the latter.

These predefined policies are created by the system and are not editable or removable.

== Create or edit a cleanup policy

At the Cleanup Policies page, choose the *Create* button.
