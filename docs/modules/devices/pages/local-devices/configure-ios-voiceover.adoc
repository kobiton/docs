:navtitle: Configure iOS VoiceOver

Learn how to configure iOS VoiceOver so you can run xref:manual-testing:local-devices/ios-voiceover-commands.adoc[iOS VoiceOver commands] to test your app's screen reader compatibility during your test session.

== Before you start

You'll need the following:

* A local Kobiton server (Cloud or Standalone) installed with a Kobiton GEM or Orion Audio Board Card.
* An iOS device running iOS 12.0 or later.

[NOTE]
Due to Apple's policies, this feature is only available for local Kobiton servers with link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11_5-release-notes[macOS Big Sur 11.5] or earlier.

== Configure VoiceOver

On the local Kobiton server, open *System Preferences*, and turn on *Bluetooth*. Take note of the name under *This Mac is discoverable as...*

[NOTE]
You will not use an HDMI connection during testing, however this setting is still required for full VoiceOver functionality.

Now you can run xref:manual-testing:local-devices/ios-voiceover-commands.adoc[iOS VoiceOver commands] during a manual test session.
