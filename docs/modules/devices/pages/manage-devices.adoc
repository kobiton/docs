To reserve a device for exclusive use for a set period of time, select the *Retain* drop-down and choose a duration. Available options are typically _1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours,_ or _Unlimited_.

Once a device is retained, its status changes to *Retained*, and the countdown displays the remaining time along with the email address of the user who retained it. Be sure to release the retain when you are finished using the device.

[NOTE]
The cleanup policy (if activated) does not run in between sessions when a device is Retained.

=== Cancel retain

[NOTE]
A retain can be canceled either by the user who created the retain or by any user with the role permission to xref:organization:roles/user-roles-and-permissions.adoc#_cancel_retain[cancel retains,window=read-later].
