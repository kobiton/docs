== Before you start

* Follow xref:android-devices/prepare-android-device.adoc[this guide] to prepare the device before continuing.

* Find the UDID of the device and note it down.

== Connect Cambrionix hub to the host

[NOTE]
====

Skip this step if the Mac mini host or GEM already has a Cambrionix hub connected.

====

Make sure you use a xref:/deviceConnect/hardware-requirements-for-deviceconnect.adoc[supported model] of Cambrionix hub.

Connect the Cambrionix hub to a power source. The power LED indicator of the Cambrionix hub should turn on.

For Standard mode, connect the Mac mini to the **host** port of the hub.

For Lightning mode, connect the Graphic Extension Manager (GEM) to the **host** port of the hub. Make sure you connect the Cambrionix hub to the blue USB 3.0 port on the GEM.

Refer to the hub model’s user manual from Cambrionix for the exact host port location.

See below for an example of the SuperSync15 with the Host port visible.

== Connect the device to the host

Make sure you have properly xref:android-devices/prepare-android-device.adoc[prepared the device] for hosting on Kobiton.

For Standard mode, connect the mobile device to the Cambrionix hub that is attached to the Mac mini host.

For Lightning mode, connect the mobile device to the Cambrionix hub that is attached to the GEM.

Check the device to see if it is charging after connecting. If it is not charging, the USB cable might be malfunctioning, or the Cambrionix hub is not connected to a power source.

== Establish trust pairing between the device and the host

Access the Mac mini host directly, or via screen sharing.

Follow the appropriate steps based on whether you are using Standard or Lightning mode.

Standard mode::
+
--

* Open Terminal and enter the following command. This must be run at least once after deviceConnect is installed:

    /usr/local/deviceconnect/bin/adb devices

* The UDID of the device should show up in the output.

--

Lightning mode::
+
--

* Make sure that `adb` is not running on the Mac mini by opening Terminal and enter the below command:

    /usr/local/deviceconnect/bin/adb kill-server

* Still in Terminal, SSH to the GEM using the customerAdmin account:

    ssh customerAdmin@1.1.1.1

** Replace 1.1.1.1 with the actual IP address of the GEM

* Run the below command to check if the GEM can recognize the plugged in device:

    adb devices

* The UDID of the device should show up in the output.

Choose the **File Transfer** option.

Wait until the device screen changes to the below before continuing:

== Verify device is available in Kobiton

Open Chrome on the Mac mini, then open `localhost` and login.

Navigate to Devices. The connected **device** displays as **Available**.

image::device-lab-management:device-lab-management-add-android-verify-device-availability.PNG[width=600, alt="The connected device displays as Available in the Devices section"]

Still in Chrome, open the Kobiton web portal and log in using an account with ADMIN role.

Select the profile picture and choose **Settings**, then choose **Device Management**.

In the search bar, enter the device’s UDID and hit Enter to filter.

The device should appear in the filter result. If the state of the device is *Utilizing*, it is being cleaned up. Wait about 2-3 minutes for the cleanup to complete.

When the cleanup is done, the device state becomes *Online* and the **Launch** button is available. Select it to launch a Manual session on the device.

image::device-lab-management:device-lab-management-add-android-launch-a-manual-session.png[width=1200, alt="Device state is Online and the Launch button is now available"]

In the Manual session, try the following to verify if the device is working properly:

* xref:manual-testing:device-controls.adoc[Navigate around, window=_blank].

* xref:manual-testing:install-an-app.adoc[Install an app, window=_blank].

* Browse the web (if the device has a Wi-Fi connection).

* xref:manual-testing:device-controls.adoc#_speedometer[Enable Lightning mode, window=_blank] (if the device is configured for Lightning mode).

If all the above works, you have successfully added the device.
