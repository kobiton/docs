== Before you start

You'll need the following:

* A supported xref:supported-platforms:mobile-operating-systems-and-devices.adoc[Android device model].

[CAUTION]
This action will remove all data on the device, back up the device before proceeding.

Refer to the device model's manual for instructions to factory reset the device.

== Enable USB debugging (required)

[IMPORTANT]
====

This step is required for Kobiton software to control the device.

From the Home screen, swipe up to show all apps. Open **Settings**.

Scroll down and select **About phone**. For some models, such as Google Pixel, this option is under **System**.
