:navtitle: Perform a remote deviceConnect update

Cloud and Hybrid customers who host dedicated devices can remotely update *deviceConnect* on Mac mini hosts through the Kobiton Portal. Updates can run automatically when a new release is available, or they can be initiated manually by an administrator.

This guide describes how remote updates work, how to perform a manual update, and how to change the update behavior for an organization.

== How remote updates work

By default, *deviceConnect* updates run automatically.

The system software periodically checks for a new *deviceConnect* release. When an update is available, it is downloaded and installed automatically *only* when none of the devices hosted by the Mac mini are in use.

If any device has an active session, the update is skipped and retried during the next check, which occurs approximately every 30 minutes.

[NOTE]
Automatic updates apply only to *deviceConnect* on Mac mini hosts. They do not apply to GigaCap on Dell servers.
Environments that include a Dell server require a manual upgrade coordinated with Kobiton Support.

== Prerequisites

* Cloud or Hybrid deployment
* Kobiton administrator with the *ADMIN* predefined permission

== Perform a manual deviceConnect update

A manual update can be performed when an update is available for one or more Mac mini hosts.

When a notification banner appears in the Kobiton Portal, at least one Mac mini host in the organization is eligible for an update.

=== To perform a manual update

. Sign in to the Kobiton Portal using an administrator account.
. Select the profile name or picture, then select *Settings*.
. Select the *Device Management* tab.
. Locate the Mac mini host to update.
* Mac mini hosts that are not running the latest *deviceConnect* version display a warning icon next to their name.
. Select *Upgrade* for the appropriate Mac mini host.
. In the confirmation dialog, click *Upgrade* to proceed.

=== During the update:

* Any active sessions on devices hosted by the Mac mini are terminated.
* No actions can be performed on the Mac mini or its connected devices.
* All controls in *Device Management* are temporarily disabled.

After the update completes, devices return online automatically. Verify the *deviceConnect* version on the Mac mini host to confirm that the update was successful.

== Change the deviceConnect update type

Automatic updates are enabled by default to maintain compatibility with the Kobiton Portal and to provide access to new features and fixes.

Some organizations prefer to manage updates manually. Before disabling automatic updates, review this change with the Kobiton account team to confirm that it aligns with operational requirements.

=== To enable manual updates

. Sign in to the Kobiton Portal using an administrator account.
. Select the profile name or picture, then select *Settings*.
. Select the *Device Management* tab.
. In the *New version upgrade* section, open the update type dropdown.
* *Automatic* is selected by default when at least one Mac mini host is online.
. Select *Manual*, then select *Save*.

== deviceConnect version policy

* Mac mini hosts are expected to run *deviceConnect* within one major version of the current release.
** For example, if the current release is *4.22*, supported versions include *4.21 and later*.
* Versions outside this range may not be fully tested or supported, and compatibility with newer Portal features is not guaranteed.
* When a *deviceConnect* version is no longer supported, devices hosted on that version may be taken offline to prevent compatibility or stability issues.
** When this occurs, the message “*Kobiton upgrade required*” appears in the *Message* section of the *Device Management* page.
* Update *deviceConnect* manually to restore device availability.
