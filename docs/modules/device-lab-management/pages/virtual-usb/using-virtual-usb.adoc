:navtitle: Using virtualUSB {beta}

virtualUSB allows users to develop, debug, and test apps on Private and Local mobile devices hosted on the Kobiton Portal.

virtualUSB is available as an option for the Enterprise plan. Please contact support@kobiton.com or your Account Executive if you are interested in adding this feature.

See this guide for how to set up and configure virtualUSB. Once the setup is done, open virtualUSB and start exploring the features below.

== Device list

The first thing you'll see when you sign into virtualUSB is the list of the Private and Local online devices assigned to you (from all of your assigned teams):

With the above list, you can:

* Use the search bar on top of the device list to find devices by Display Name, Model Name, or UDID.

* Hover on a device's Display Name, Model Name, or UDID to show the full text when the text is long. You can also copy the information by clicking the *Copy* icon:

== Connect to a device

On the device list, select the *Connect* button for a device:

Once connected:

* The device status changes to *Retained*. This status persists for 24 hours unless the device is disconnected sooner.

* The *Connection Status* column displays the value *Connected*.

Repeat the above step to connect to additional devices.

To filter and view the list currently connected devices, select the *Show Connected Devices* checkbox on the right of the search bar. Unselect the checkbox to clear the filter and view all devices.

== Check connected devices

=== Android devices

In Android Studio, select *Device Manager* from the run configurations dropdown menu:

=== iOS devices

You can check iOS devices two ways.

First, open Finder. The connected devices are listed under *Locations*:

The other way is to view connected iOS devices in Xcode:

== Launch a manual session

To observe what is happening on the device screen while connected to a device via virtualUSB, sign in to the Kobiton Portal, find the device, and launch a manual session with a virtualUSB. (Hint: copy the device UDID from virtualUSB and paste it in the search bar of the Kobiton Portal Device List.)

Manual sessions will end after staying idle for a certain period of time. To prevent an accidental session end, open the *Manual Session Settings* while in the manual session, uncheck *Quit session after staying idle for 10 minutes* in the pop-up, and click *Apply*.

Confirm the action by selecting *Disconnect* in the next dialog:

== Save log

To save a log of activities in virtualUSB, click the *Save Logs* icon on the left side of the user's avatar:

In the next dialog, choose a time period from the dropdown list and click *Save*. A zip archive containing all the logs in the selected period will be downloaded.

== Limitations

* Kobiton does not provide support for admins to terminate the virtualUSB connection of another user. Admins can cancel a retained device while it is connected via virtualUSB, but this is not recommended as other users will see those devices with *Online* status but not be able connect to them, i.e. users will receive an error when trying to connect via virtualUSB.

* After clicking the *Connect* button, users may occasionally see the connection status changes to *Offline* or *Error* before showing *Connected*. Kobiton will address this behavior in an upcoming release.

* If a user right-clicks on any part of the virtualUSB app and selects *Reload*, the user will be directed back to the login page and need to sign in again.

* You cannot run virtualUSB from a Mac that has deviceConnect or Kobiton Desktop installed.

* Device connection status is not synced across machines when a user logs in virtualUSB on different machines simultaneously.

* When a device is connected via virtualUSB and you restart the device:

** the virtualUSB connection will be re-established.

** the device status will be back to *Online* and you should manually retain that device to avoid interruption.
