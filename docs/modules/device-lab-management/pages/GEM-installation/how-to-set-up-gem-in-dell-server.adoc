:navtitle: How to setup GEM in a blank Dell server i.e. no existing OS in the disk drive

This document describes how to install the GEM to a blank Dell server so that we can remotely access to the Dell for installing Standalone or configuring peering with deviceConnect.

== Getting started

1. This section requires physical interaction with the server, so please plug the monitor and keyboard into the Dell server.

2. Plug the GEM bootable USB stick into the Dell, see xref:GEM-installation/make-a-gem-bootable.adoc[Process to make a GEM-bootable USB stick] for creating a GEM bootable USB stick.

3. Power on the Dell,  press F11 to get into Boot menu.

4. Select One-Shot UEFI Boot Menu > Select the USB stick
to boot from and wait for NixOS Boot sequence completed.

5. Log in as *root*, no password is needed.

6. Run the install-gem command, it will prompt you for the disk drive that you want to install GEM firmware. It’s usually /dev/sda while the /dev/sdb is the USB stick.

It shows as belows:
