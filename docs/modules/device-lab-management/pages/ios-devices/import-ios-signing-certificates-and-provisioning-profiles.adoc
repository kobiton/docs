[#_before_you_start]
== Before you start

* Export the appropriate xref:ios-devices/generate-an-ios-signing-certificate-and-provisioning-profile.adoc#_generate_a_signing_certificate[signing certificates] (`.p12`) and xref:ios-devices/generate-an-ios-signing-certificate-and-provisioning-profile.adoc#_generate_a_provisioning_profile[provisioning profiles] (`.mobileprovision`) for the UDID of the device, then transfer the exported files into the Mac mini host.

* Download the https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer[Apple Worldwide Developer Relations - G3,window=read-later] (`AppleWWDRCAG3.cer`) file. *Note*: This is only required if you have not imported the Apple G3 Intermediate Certificate into the System keychain.

* Log into the Mac mini host(s) as the `deviceconnect` user. All the below sections needs to be performed on the Mac mini host.

== Import Apple Worldwide Developer Relations G3 certificate

Open *Keychain Access* on the Mac mini host.

Select the *System* keychain, then select the tab *Certificates*.

Drag and drop the `AppleWWDRCAG3.cer` file into the Certificates list of the System keychain.

Input the admin password to continue.

Double-check that the *Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority* certificate appears in the list.

Double-click the above certificate to view its details. Double-check that under *Details*, the *Organizational Unit* is *G3*. If the value is different, such as *G2* or *G6*, download link:++https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer[the correct certificate,window=read-later] and import again.

Open *Keychain Access* on the Mac mini host.

Select the *System* keychain, then select the tab *Certificates*.

Drag and drop the `.p12` file(s) into the Certificates list of the System keychain.

[IMPORTANT]
To be able to drag and drop the `.p12` file(s) into the Keychain Access app, the file(s) must be password-protected. If the file(s) are not password-protected, use the *Terminal command* to import them instead.

Input the admin password to continue.

[IMPORTANT]
These steps require accessing the Mac mini hostâ€™s screen and cannot be done via SSH.

Open **Terminal** on the Mac mini host and enter the following command, replacing *<Path to the cert>* with the full path to the `.p12` certificate files and *<Name of the cert>* with the filename.

----
sudo security import <Path to the cert>/<Name of the cert>.p12 -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain -A
----

Enter the certificate password. If the certificate has no password, leave the field blank and click **OK**.

====

After importing, open *Keychain Access* on the Mac mini host (if not already opened).

Select the *System* keychain, then select the tab *Certificates*. Double-check that:

* The imported certificate(s) appear in the list and there is an associated private key when expanding the certificate.

* The certificate status says *This certificate is valid*.

[#_key_access_control]
Expand the certificate, then right-click the associated private key and select *Get info*.

Select the *Access Control* tab, then choose *Allow all applications to access this item* (skip this step if the option is already selected).

Enter the admin password to continue in the pop-up.

In the next pop-up, input `deviceconnect` for username and its password, then choose *Allow*.

Close the key information pop-up.

[#_verify_imported_certificates_and_upload_provisioning_profiles_for_deviceconnect]
== Confirm imported certificates and upload provisioning profiles for deviceConnect

Before importing, if your deployment include multiple Mac mini hosts, make sure the Mac mini host has deviceConnect installed by opening the Chrome browser, navigating to the address: *localhost/#/System/IOS*, and logging in.

[IMPORTANT]
Only proceed if you can access the page and log in. Else, move on to the next Mac mini host.

Under **Available signing certificates**, you can see all imported certificates from the above step.

[IMPORTANT]
xref:deviceConnect/restart-deviceconnect-services.adoc[Restart deviceConnect services] to apply the new provisioning profiles.

[#_resolve_common_errors_with_certificates_and_provisioning_profiles]
== Resolve common errors with certificates and provisioning profiles

[NOTE]
This section provides possible resolutions to common errors related to certificates and provisioning profiles.

Open the Chrome browser on the Mac mini host, then navigate to the address: *localhost/#/System/IOS*, and log in.

[TIP]
This page can also be accessed from the menu by selecting *System*, then choose *iOS Management*.

The *iOS Provisioning Status* page displays. This page has the following main sections:

* *Devices*: If you have xref:ios-devices/add-ios-device.adoc[connected the device,window=read_later] and deviceConnect can recognize it, it will display in the list under *Devices*.
** For each connected device, check the *Provisioning Profile* columns first. If you see the green check icon, then there is no issue with the certificate or provisioning profile.
** If you see the red cross icon instead, then there is one or more issues that needs to be addressed. You can select *Details* to view the issue.

* *Installed provisioning profile*: All imported provisioning profiles are included here. If there is an error with the provisioning profile, a message starting with
_Failed:_ displays.

* *Available signing certificates*: All imported signing certificates are included here. If there is an error with the certificate, a message starting with
_Failed:_ displays.



[NOTE]
====

When there is an issue regarding signing certificate and profiles with at least 1 device, a warning permanently displays on the page until all issues are resolved. To dismiss the warning when all issues a resolved, a xref:deviceConnect/restart-deviceconnect-services.adoc[service restart,window=read_later] is required.



====

Below are common error messages and how to fix them.

=== Common errors with signing certificate

Issues with signing certificates are reported under *Available signing certificates*.

* _There are no signing certificates available._

** No signing certificate can be recognized by the system. Ensure you have imported the xref:#_import_developer_certificates[signing certificate] into the correct location.

*  _Failed: An associated private key has restricted access_: The private key access is limited.

** Set the *Access Control* of its associated private key to  xref:_key_access_control[Allow all applications to access this item], then xref:deviceConnect/restart-deviceconnect-services.adoc[restart deviceConnect,window=read-later] and make sure the error no longer displays.

* _Failed: certificate is expired_

** If all imported certificates are expired, xref:device-lab-management:ios-devices/generate-an-ios-signing-certificate-and-provisioning-profile.adoc#_generate_a_signing_certificate[generate a new certificate] then xref:#_import_developer_certificates[import] it.

** If there is already a working certificate that is not expired, there is no issue to resolve. You can remove the expired certificates.

=== Common errors with provisioning profiles

Issues with signing certificates are reported under *Installed provisioning profiles*.

* _There are no provisioning profiles installed_

**  Ensure you have imported the xref:#_verify_imported_certificates_and_upload_provisioning_profiles_for_deviceconnect[provisioning profile] into the correct location.

* _Failed: profile expired_

** If all provisioning profiles are expired, xref:device-lab-management:ios-devices/generate-an-ios-signing-certificate-and-provisioning-profile.adoc#_generate_a_provisioning_profile[generate,window=read_later] or xref:ios-devices/generate-an-ios-signing-certificate-and-provisioning-profile.adoc#_edit_a_provisioning_profile[edit,window=read_later] a provisioning profile then xref:#_import_developer_certificates[import] it.

** If there is already a working provisioning profile that is not expired, there is no issue to resolve. You can remove the expired provisioning profiles.

* _Failed: No signing certificate available._

** *Explanation:* The provisioning profile is not associated with any certificate(s) that is recognized by the system. Either there is no signing certificate imported, or the imported signing certificates are not selected when generating the provisioning profile.

** Make sure you have selected the correct signing certificate when generating the provisioning profile. You can always xref:ios-devices/generate-an-ios-signing-certificate-and-provisioning-profile.adoc#_edit_a_provisioning_profile[edit,window=read_later] and add the certificate.

+

[TIP]
====

* To verify that a certificate matches a provisioning profile, select the *Plus* icon of a provisioning profile to expand it, then compare the *Certificate ID* information under the provisioning profile with that of the signing certificate. If they are the same, then the certificate matches the provisioning profile.

* A provisioning profile can match multiple certificates and vice versa.

* On the Apple Developer site, the certificates do not have the certificate ID displayed and may have duplicated names. If in doubt, select all possible signing certificate when generating or editing the provisioning profile.

====

=== Common errors with provisioned device UDIDs

The errors regarding provisioned device UDIDs can be found in the *Details* of a device when there is a red cross icon.

* _Failed: ProvisionedDevices does not contain device udid_

** *Explanation*: The device's UDID is not included in any installed provisioning profiles. It is possible that the device is not added to Apple Developer, or the device UDID is not checked when generating or editing the provisioning profile.

** Make sure you have added the device to Apple Developer and selected the device UDID when generating the provisioning profile. You can always xref:ios-devices/generate-an-ios-signing-certificate-and-provisioning-profile.adoc#_edit_a_provisioning_profile[edit,window=read_later] and add the device UDID.



[#_import_developer_certificates_and_provisioning_profiles_to_deviceshare]
== Import developer certificates and provisioning profiles to deviceShare

[NOTE]
Skip this section if you do not use Kobiton app re-signing service.

[IMPORTANT]
====

If your deployment includes multiple Mac mini hosts, ensure that deviceShare is installed on the current Mac mini host before proceeding.

To check if deviceShare is installed on the Mac mini host, navigate to the path `/usr/local/kobiton/` and check for the presence of the `deviceshare` folder. If there is no such folder or the folder is empty, it means deviceShare is not installed. In this case, locate another Mac mini host where deviceShare is installed to continue with this section.

====

Open the **Keychain Access** app.

Select the **System** keychain, and then **Certificates**. You will see your **Apple Development** signing certificates along with all the other certificates. Expand all the **Apple Development** signing certificates to show the private key like the below:

image::device-lab-management:device-lab-management-ios-add-ios-system-certificate-apple-development.PNG[width=600,alt="Private key inside the Apple Development certificates"]

Shift-click to select all the **Apple Development** certificates and their private key, then right-click and select **Copy items**.

image::device-lab-management:device-lab-management-ios-add-ios-system-certificate-apple-development-copy-items.PNG[width=600,alt="Copying the keys from Apple Development certificates"]

Select the **deviceshare** keychain and then **Certificates**. Right-click the empty area and choose **Paste items**. You will be prompted to enter your login keychain password and the password for the *deviceshare* keychain for each certificate imported.

[NOTE]
====


Retrieve the *deviceshare* keychain passwword from the `deviceshare_config.toml` file under the location `/usr/local/kobiton/deviceshare/`. The password is the <secret> value of the below line in the file:

----

ios_keychain_paths = [
"/usr/local/kobiton/deviceshare/keychains/deviceshare.keychain@<secret>"
]

----

In the below example, the password for the `deviceshare` keychain is `Rand0m429!`

----

ios_keychain_paths = [
"/usr/local/kobiton/deviceshare/keychains/deviceshare.keychain@Rand0m429!"
]

----

====

image::device-lab-management:device-lab-management-ios-add-ios-system-certificate-apple-development-paste-items.PNG[width=600,alt="Pasting the keys of Apple Develeopment certificates in deiceshare certificates"]

Verify that the certificates and keys are imported successfully into the `deviceshare` keychain.

Open the *deviceshare_config.toml* file located under */usr/local/kobiton/deviceshare/*.

Locate the line starting with `ios_provisioning_profile_paths` .

If the line is the same as below, skip this section as deviceShare is using the same folder with deviceConnect for provisioning profiles:

----
ios_provisioning_profile_paths = [
    "/usr/local/deviceconnect/ProvisioningProfiles"
]
----

If the line is the same as below instead, continue on the next step:

----
ios_provisioning_profile_paths = [
    "/usr/local/kobiton/deviceshare/provisioning_profiles"
]
----

Move all provisioning profile files into one folder and note down the location. Open Terminal and execute the below command, where */path/to/profiles/* is the location of all the provisioning profile files:

----
cp -R /path/to/profiles/*.mobileprovision /usr/local/kobiton/deviceshare/provisioning_profiles
----

Restart deviceShare signing service to apply all the configurations above by running this command:

----
sudo /bin/launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.kobiton.deviceshare.signing.plist && sleep 5 && sudo /bin/launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.kobiton.deviceshare.signing.plist
----

Verify that the deviceShare signing service is running normally by executing the below command:

----
tail -100 /usr/local/kobiton/deviceshare/deviceshare_signing.log
----

A successful execution should show the output as below:
