Learn how to prepare iOS/iPadOS devices to be utilized with Kobiton.

Different models of devices and versions of iOS/iPadOS may have different layouts for settings and options. Refer to Apple's official manual if you cannot find the options mentioned in this document.

== Before you start

You'll need the following:

* A supported xref:supported-platforms:mobile-operating-systems-and-devices.adoc[iOS/iPadOS device].
* Any Mac machine with Xcode installed. You can also use the Mac mini host where deviceConnect is installed.

== Factory reset the device (optional)

[NOTE]
This step is highly recommended for devices that were hosted by Legacy Kobiton or Legacy Gigafox.

[IMPORTANT]
This action will remove all data on the device. Back up the device before proceeding.

Follow Apple's official guide to link:https://support.apple.com/guide/personal-safety/how-to-erase-all-content-and-settings-ips4603248a8/web[erase all contents and settings,window=_blank] for your device model.

== Turn on developer mode and UI automation (required)

[IMPORTANT]
====

This step is required for Kobiton software to control the device.

====

Plug the device into the Mac machine with Xcode installed. Open Xcode on the Mac machine.

Tap *Trust* in Finder of the machine and on the *Trust this computer* alert on the iOS/iPadOS device.

Follow the specific steps for your device's OS version.

== Turn off auto update (optional)

A software update makes the device unavailable for use until the update is complete. Turning auto update off is recommended.

====

Open the Settings app. Tap *General* -> *Software Update* -> *Automatic Updates*.

Turn off *Install iOS Updates*.

== Turn off passcode, if one is set (required)

[IMPORTANT]
====

Setting a passcode on a device prevents Kobiton software from controlling it.

To use passcode on the device, contact Kobiton support to enable passcode mode for your organization.

====

In the *Settings* app, select *Face ID & Passcode* or *Touch ID & Passcode*.

Enter the current passcode.

Tap *Turn Passcode Off*.

Enter the current passcode again to turn off passcode.

== Turn off Bringing Devices Together (required)

[IMPORTANT]
====

The *Bringing Devices Together* feature (introduced with iOS 17) blocks the device from functioning normally in a manual session.

====

In the *Settings* app, select *General* -> *AirDrop*.

Turn off *Bringing Devices Together*.

== Turn on web inspector in Safari (required by specific features)

[NOTE]
====

This step is required if you want to use the Kobiton Inspector and/or web automation on the device.

====

Under the *Settings* app, tap *Safari*.

Scroll down to the *Advanced* option and tap it.

Turn on *Web Inspector* and *Remote Automation*.

== Turn off automatic brightness and auto-lock (optional)

[NOTE]
====

Turning off automatic brightness allows Kobiton software to keep the device screen brightness at the minimum, thus saving battery life.

Disabling auto-lock improves the experience of testers by not having to unlock the device after a certain amount of time.

====

Under the *Settings* app, tap *Display & Brightness*.

Turn off *Automatic*.
