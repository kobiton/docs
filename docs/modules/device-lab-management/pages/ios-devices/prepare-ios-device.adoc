:navtitle: Prepare an iOS/iPadOS device

Learn how to prepare iOS/iPadOS devices to be utilized with Kobiton 4.0 and later.

Different models of devices and versions of iOS/iPadOS may have different layout for settings and options. Refer to Apple's official manual if you cannot find the options mentioned in this document.

== Before you start

You'll need the following:

* An iOS/iPadOS device
* Any Mac machine with Xcode installed. You can also use the Mac mini host where deviceConnect is installed.

== Factory reset the device (optional)

[NOTE]
This step is optional. It is highly recommended for devices that were hosted by Legacy Kobiton or Legacy Gigafox.

[IMPORTANT]
This action will remove all data on the device, back up the device before proceeding.

Follow Apple's official guide to https://support.apple.com/guide/personal-safety/how-to-erase-all-content-and-settings-ips4603248a8/web[erase all contents and settings] for your device model.

== Turn off auto update (optional)

[NOTE]
====

This step is optional but highly recommended. A software update makes the device unavailable for use until the update is complete.

====

Open the Settings app. Tap *General* -> *Software Update* -> *Automatic Updates*.

Turn off *Install iOS Updates*.

Go back to the Settings screen and tap *App Store*.

Under *Automatic Downloads*, turn off *App Updates*.

== Turn off passcode, if one is set (required)

[IMPORTANT]
====

This step is required. Setting a passcode on a device prevents Kobiton software from controlling it.

To use passcode on the device, request Kobiton to enable passcode mode for your organization.

====

In the *Settings* app, select *Face ID & Passcode* or *Touch ID & Passcode*.

Enter the current passcode.

Tap *Turn Passcode Off*.

Enter the current passcode again to turn off passcode.

== Turn on web inspector in Safari (required by specific features)

[NOTE]
====

This step is required if you want to use the Kobiton Inspector and/or web automation on the device.

====

Under the *Settings* app, tap *Safari*.

Scroll down to the *Advanced* option and tap it.

Turn on *Web Inspector* and *Remote Automation*.

== Turn off automatic brightness and auto-lock (optional)

[NOTE]
====

This step is optional but recommended.

Turning off automatic brightness allow Kobiton software to keep the device screen brightness at the minimum, thus saving battery life.

Disabling auto-lock improves the experience of testers by not having to unlock the device after a certain amount of time.

====

Under the *Settings* app, tap *Display & Brightness*.

Turn off *Automatic*

image::ios-display-brighness-context-automatic.png[width=500,alt="The Automatic otpion switched off under under Display and Brightness settings"]

Tap *Auto-Lock*.

image::ios-display-brighness-context.png[width=500,alt="The Auto-Lock option under Display and Brightness settings"]

Select *Never*.

== Turn on developer mode and UI automation (required)

[IMPORTANT]
====

This step is required for Kobiton software to control the device.

====

Plug the device into the Mac machine with Xcode installed. Open Xcode on the Mac machine.

Tap *Trust* in Finder of the machine and on the *Trust this computer* alert on the iOS/iPadOS device.

Follow the specific steps for your device's OS version.
