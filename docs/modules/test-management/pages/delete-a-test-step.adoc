:navtitle: Delete a test step

Once a manual session has run and the test execution plan is available, you can delete any step on that execution list.

To delete a step from a manual test:

1. After running the manual test, on the NOVA popup click yes.
2. Open the Data Driven Testing tab and next to the step to be deleted, click the + button and click delete.

The Test Execution plan will no longer include the deleted step.
