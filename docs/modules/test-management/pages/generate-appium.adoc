= Generate an Appium script

== Overview

An Appium script can be generated from an existing test case created from a baseline session.

The generated script reflects the recorded interactions captured during the manual session and can be used in external, script-based automation workflows.

Generating an Appium script is optional. Running tests in the platform does not require exporting or maintaining scripts.

== Before you begin

Before generating an Appium script:

* A baseline session must be completed
* The baseline session must be converted into a test case
* Any required remediation must be resolved

== Export an Appium script

Appium scripts are generated from the test case view in the platform.

From the test case:

* Open the test case associated with the baseline session
* Select the option to export an Appium script
* Choose a supported language and test framework
* Download the generated script

The exported script includes the recorded actions and element interactions captured during the baseline session.

== Supported languages and frameworks

Appium scripts can be generated using the following language and framework combinations:

* Java (TestNG)
* Java (JUnit)
* Node.js (Mocha)
* C# (NUnit)

== Using the generated script

The generated Appium script can be extended, modified, or integrated into existing automation frameworks.

Changes made to the script outside the platform do not affect the original test case or future test runs executed in the platform.
