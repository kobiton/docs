== Access the Dynamic Data section

In the Dynamic Data section, you will see the “Manual” chipset, demonstrating the original values from your manual session and these values could not be modified.

NOTE: Currently Scriptless Automation only supports defining a new dataset for the test action “Set_Text" only. Stay tuned! Scriptless Automation will provide an ability to define more advanced assertions for the dynamic test case like Text Validations, Element Visible, etc. in our upcoming release.

== Set new value

A created dataset will clone all values from a manual session as a default value, then you can modify these values again as your preferred set.

NOTE: For any values that are different from a manual, you will see the indicator “Edited” to demonstrate a new value.
