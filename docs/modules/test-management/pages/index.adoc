= Test Management

== Overview

Test Management provides the structure used to organize, execute, and review automated tests created from manual sessions.

Within the Kobiton platform, Test Management is where test cases are stored, grouped, and reused. It also provides visibility into test execution and results across devices and application versions.

== How Test Management fits into testing

Test Management separates test definition from test execution.

Test cases represent recorded test flows derived from baseline sessions. These test cases can be executed repeatedly without recreating the original session.

Each execution produces a test run, which records the outcome of running a test case or test suite on one or more devices. Test runs and their results are tracked independently of the test definitions they use.

== Core objects

Test Management is built around a small set of core objects.

=== Test cases

Reusable definitions created from baseline sessions. Test cases describe what should be tested.

=== Test runs

Individual executions of a test case or test suite. Test runs capture results and execution details.

=== Test suites

Collections of related test cases grouped for execution and organization.

=== Test reruns

Repeat executions of a previous test run using the same configuration, typically used for validation.

== What’s next

From Test Management, users can:

* Create and manage test cases
* Run tests across devices
* Review execution results
* Rerun tests after remediation
* Generate Appium scripts for automation testing
