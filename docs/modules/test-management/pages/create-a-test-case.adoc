:navtitle: Create a test case

Learn how to create a test case from a baseline session. A test case is a template that includes all test steps performed in the baseline session. This test case can then be used to re-run test steps on different devices using Scriptless Automation.

== Before you start

You'll need to complete the following:

* xref:scriptless-automation:create-a-baseline-session.adoc[Create a baseline session for Scriptless Automation].

== Create a new test case

There are two possible ways to create a test case:

=== Convert an existing session into a new test case in Session Explorer

Access the *Session Overview* or *Session Explorer* page using either option:

* Automatic redirection after completing a manual session.
* Select a session from the *Session List*.

If the session qualifies for scriptless, the *Convert to Test Case* button is available. Select it to convert the session into a test case.

After the conversion finishes, the *Convert to Test Case* button turns into *View Test Case*. Select it to view the test case details.

If the AI is still analyzing, an error message displays instead. Wait a while before selecting Convert to Test Case again.

=== Create a test case from a list of available sessions in Test Management

Select the *Test Management* icon from the menu, then choose the *Test Cases* tab. Select *New Test Case*.

Choose a baseline session to convert to test case. Only sessions that qualify for scriptless and have not been converted appear here. Select *Convert*.

If the AI analysis is complete, a success message with an option to *View Test Case* displays. To navigate to the test case details, you can either:

* Select *View Test Case*.
* Select the new *ID* in the Test Cases List.
