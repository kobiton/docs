= Test reruns

== Overview

A test rerun is a repeat execution of a previous test run using the same configuration.

Reruns are used to validate results without redefining the test or changing execution settings. Each rerun is recorded as a separate execution and does not replace the original test run.

== When test reruns are used

Test reruns are typically used after an issue has been addressed or when execution needs to be validated again.

Common scenarios include:

* Verifying execution after remediation
* Confirming behavior following an application update
* Repeating a test run to validate consistency

Reruns ensure that results can be compared directly across executions.

== How reruns differ from new test runs

A rerun repeats a previous test run using the same test definition, devices, and configuration.

Creating a new test run allows changes to be made to the test setup, such as selecting different devices or modifying execution parameters.

Both approaches create independent execution records, but reruns preserve the original execution context.

== Where reruns appear

Reruns are managed through Test Management and appear as separate test runs.

Each rerun is listed with its own name and execution details. The rerun name includes a reference to the original test run ID, which can be used to identify the source of the rerun.

Reruns can be reviewed individually to evaluate execution results after remediation or validation.
