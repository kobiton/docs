:navtitle: Crash remediation

If there's a crash during any execution, Scriptless Automation automatically detects it and provides the relevant crash log within the remediation process. Scriptless Automation offers remediation actions, like *Ignore* or *Report Bug*.

For example, if a crash occurs on a Samsung S9 during a revisit, Scriptless Automation promptly captures it, initiating a remediation process. This process includes the specific crash log and vital device information, such as the OS, OS version, and resolution. This data equips testers with valuable insights to investigate the issue.
