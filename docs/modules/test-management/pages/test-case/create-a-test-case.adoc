:navtitle: Create a test case


Learn how to create a test case from a baseline session. A test case serves as a template, capturing the test steps performed in the baseline session. You can use this test case to generate an Appium script or rerun it using Scriptless Automation.

== Before you start

You'll need to complete the following:

* xref:scriptless-automation:create-a-baseline-session.adoc[Create a baseline session for Scriptless Automation]

== Create a new test case

You can create a test case in two ways: from Session Explorer or the Test Case List. This section explains both methods.

=== Create a test case from an existing session in Session Explorer

First, select a session to view in Session Explorer. You will either be redirected to Session Explorer after completing a manual session or can select a session from the Session List.

In the Test Result Analysis Insights Panel in the top left of Session Explorer, select *Convert to Test Case*.

Once the conversion is complete, the *Convert to Test Case* button changes to *View Test Case*. Select it to access the test case details.

[NOTE]
====

* If a baseline session does not meet minimum requirements to become a test case (e.g. no actions performed), the button will not be clickable.
* If your session just ended, you may see a tooltip when you select the button asking you to wait a few moments for the session to complete processing before trying again.

=== Create a test case from the list of available sessions in Test Management

Select *Test Management* from the left-hand menu and choose the *Test Cases* tab. Select *New Test Case*.

Choose a baseline session from the list. Only sessions that qualify for scriptless and have not already been converted appear here. Select *Convert*.

If the AI analysis is complete, a success message with an option to *View Test Case* displays. To navigate to the test case details, you can either:

* Select *View Test Case* from the message.
* Select the new *ID* from the Test Cases List.

[NOTE]
====

If the AI is still analyzing, an error message displays instead. Wait a few moments before selecting *Convert* again.
