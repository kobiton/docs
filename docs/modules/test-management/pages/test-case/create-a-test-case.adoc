:navtitle: Create a test case

Learn how to create a test case from a baseline session. A test case serves as a template, capturing the test steps performed in the baseline session. You can use this test case to generate an Appium script or rerun it using Scriptless Automation.

Just like test sessions, test cases are organized by team. If you are a member of multiple teams in your organization, be sure to select the proper team in the left-hand navigation before creating your baseline session.

== Before you start

You'll need to complete the following:

* xref:scriptless-automation:create-a-baseline-session.adoc[Create a baseline session for Scriptless Automation]

== Create a new test case

You can create a test case in two ways: from Session Explorer or the Test Case List. This section explains both methods.

=== Create a test case from an existing session in Session Explorer

Access Session Explorer page via one of the following ways:

* Automatic redirection after completing a manual session.
* Select a session from the Session List.

In the *Test Result Analysis* insights panel, select *Convert to Test Case*.

Once the conversion is complete, the *Convert to Test Case* button changes to *View Test Case*. Select it to access the test case details.

[NOTE]
====

* If a baseline session does not meet minimum requirements to become a test case (e.g. no actions performed), the button will not be clickable.
* If your session just ended, you may see a tooltip when you select the button asking you to wait a few moments for the session to complete processing before trying again.

=== Create a test case from the list of available sessions in Test Management

Select *Test Management* from the left-hand menu and choose the *Test Cases* tab. Select *New Test Case*.

Search for and choose a baseline session from the list. Only sessions that qualify for scriptless and have not already been converted to a test case appear here. Select *Convert*.

If the AI analysis is complete, a success message with an option to *View Test Case* displays. To navigate to the test case details, you can either:

* Select *View Test Case* from the message.
* Select the new *ID* from the Test Cases List.

[NOTE]

If the AI is still analyzing, a message displays explaining the session is still being processed and to try again shortly.

Here are some things you can do with your new test case:

* xref:test-case/manage-test-steps.adoc[Manage test case] - update test steps, create new versions
* xref:test-run/create-and-manage-test-run.adoc[Create a test run] - create a test run with your new test case
* xref:test-suite/create-and-manage-test-suite.adoc[Add test case to a test suite] - add your test case to a new or existing test suite
