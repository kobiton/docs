:navtitle: Create and manage test run

Learn how to create and manage test runs to efficiently execute tests across multiple devices.

== What is a test run?

A test run consists of one or more sessions in which the AI performs the test steps from a test case or test suite on one or more devices. This type of session is called a revisit execution.

Things to note regarding test runs:

* The revisit session appears in the sessions list with the *Type* as Appium and the *Name* as `Revisit execution <revisit ID>` .
* A revisit session only executes one test case on one device. If a test run includes multiple test cases (a test suite) or multiple devices, it will generate multiple revisit sessions.

== Before you start

* Create a baseline session
* Create a test case
* (Optional) Remediate test steps
* (Optional) Create a test suite

== Create a Test Run

From the menu, select the *Test Management* icon. Then select *Test Runs*.

Select *New Test Run*.

The *Test Run Setup* screen displays.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-test-run-setup.PNG[width=700,alt="The Test Run Setup screen is displayed in Test Management section"]

In this screen, input the following:

* Name
* Description (optional)

Follow the next sections to configure:

* Test Case or Test Suite
* Application Versions
* Device Bundle or Individual Devices
* Device Allocation Strategy

=== Test Case or Test Suite

On *Test Run Setup* page, you can choose either *Test Case* or *Test Suite*, then choose one test case or one test suite from the dropdown list.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-test-case-or-test-suite.PNG[width=700,alt="Choose either Test Case or Test Suite"]

Optionally, you can select *Customize* to customize the test case or test suite.

* For Test Case, you can select the version to run. By default, the latest version is selected.
+
image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-customize-test-case.PNG[width=300,alt="Select the specific version to run for the test case"]
* For Test Suite, you can select or deselect the individual test cases to run, as well as the version to run for each test case.
+
image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-customize-test-suite.PNG[width=700,alt="For the given Test Suite, select or deselect test cases and version that you want to run"]

After customizing, select *Save* to confirm the changes.

=== Application Versions

After selecting a test suite or test case, the available *Application Versions* for the test case or test suite will be displayed. If an application has multiple versions, you can choose the specific version using the dropdown.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-application-versions.PNG[width=700,alt="Select the application version for the test suite or test case"]

=== Device Bundle or Individual Devices

After selecting an application version, choose either *Device Bundle* or *Individual Devices* to run the test case or test suite on.

You can select either:

* One device bundle,

+
NOTE: The NOVA Recommended Devices bundle is automatically created by the system. To create a custom bundle, follow https://docs.kobiton.com/organization/device-bundles/create-a-device-bundle[this guide].
* Or at least one device in the dropdown list for *Individual Devices*, which includes all public and private devices assigned to your current team.
+

+
NOTE: Only online devices in the portal are available for selection in the *Individual Devices* list.

If *Device Bundle* is selected, select *Customize* to choose the devices to run in that bundle, then choose *Save*.

=== Device Allocation Strategy

Next, choose a *Device Allocation Strategy*. This only applies when running a test suite.

=== Execute the test run

After filling in all required fields, select *Run* to create and execute the test run.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-execute-test-run.PNG[width=700,alt="Selecting the Run option to create and execute the test run"]

Once the test run is created, the success message appears with the option to *View Test Run*.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-test-run-created-success-message.PNG[width=700,alt="Success message appears once the run is created"]

Either select *View Test Run* on the success message, or select the newly created test run *ID* in the *Test Runs* list to view the test run results.

Alternatively, you can create a test run from a test case or a test suite.

== Run a test case or test suite

To create a test run from a test case, go to *Test Management → Test Cases*, then either:

* Select the *Play* icon in the *Test Case Details* page.
+
image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-case-details.PNG[width=700,alt="Running is test case or test suite via the Test Case Details page"]
* Choose the *3-dot* icon under *Actions* in the Test Case list, then select *Run Test Case*.

To create a test run from a test suite, go to *Test Management → Test Suite*, choose the *3-dot* icon, then select *Run Test Suite*.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-run-test-suite.PNG[width=700,alt="Creating a test run from a test suite"]

The *Test Run Setup* displays with the following information pre-filled:

* Test Case or Test Suite
* Application Versions

Choose the *Device Bundle* or *Individual Devices* to run on and *Device Allocation Strategy* (if needed), then select *Run* to create and execute the test run.

== Rerun a test run

After creating a test Run, you can quickly create a new test run with the same setup. This is called a rerun.

To do this, select the *3-dot* icon in the *Test Runs* list or *Test Run Results* page, then select *Rerun Test Run*.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-rerun-test-run.PNG[width=700,alt="Rerunning a test run via the Test Run Results page"]

The *Test Run Setup* uses the last run’s configuration, pre-filling the following information with the same values selected in the original test run:

* Test Case or Test Suite
* Application Versions
* Individual Devices or Device Bundle
* Device Allocation Strategy

Select *Run* to create and execute the test run.

== Manage a test run

To manage a test run, select the *Test Management* icon from the menu, then select *Test Runs*.

The Test Run list page displays.

image:test-management:test-run-create-and-manage-test-run-manage-a-test-run.PNG[width=700,alt="Managing test runs via the Test Run page"]

On this page, you can do the following:

* Search for test run by name, tags, OS, created by, and created on.
* Open the *Test Run Results* page by selecting the test run *ID*.
* Select the *3-dot* icon, then:
** *Rerun Test Run* to create a new test run with the same setup.
** *Terminate Test Run* to terminate all running revisit session(s).
** *Delete Test Run* to delete the test run.
