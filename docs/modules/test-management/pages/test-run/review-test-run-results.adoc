=== Revisit execution results

Below the general information, a grid displays the status of each test case’s revisit execution on each device, along with validation icons.

Possible revisit execution statuses are:

* *Running*: the revisit execution either has not started yet, or is in progress.
* *Success*: the revisit execution completed without error.
* *Failed*: the revisit execution failed because the app under test crashed.
* *Need Action*: the AI encountered a blocker and Blocker Remediation is required.
* *Error*: the revisit execution failed due to a Kobiton system issue.

Once the revisit session is created, select the status to open the *Explorer* page of the revisit session.

Next to each test case in the grid, there are several icons:

* *Sensitive data indicator*: if the Test Case has sensitive data, a lock icon displays.
