== Navigate Test Case Details

=== Delete a test step

In the baseline manual session, you might make some redundant steps such as an accidental touch or swipe and you don't want that unnecessary step to be rerun. You can delete those redundant steps from the baseline manual session by checking at the upper right corner of the step, then select image:test-management:bin-icon.png[width=30,alt="the trash icon"].

=== Modify value of a set-text step

For test steps that input string value to a field such as username, email, URLs, phone number, the value can be modified. Select underneath the test step to modify its string value.
