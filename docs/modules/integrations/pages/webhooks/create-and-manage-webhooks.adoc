:navtitle: Create and Manage

A webhook is a way to send a notification via HTTP to another application when an event occurs. You can use Kobiton webhooks to notify your app or an internal system when certain events occur in Kobiton. For example, you might use webhooks to alert your remote application when a device has gone offline or becomes available instead of periodically polling Kobiton via REST APIs to determine whether changes have occurred.

Webhooks can be set up by org admins or any role with the *org_setting.modify* permission enabled.

== Supported webhook events

A webhook is triggered to send an HTTP callback when a particular event occurs.

Kobiton currently supports creating device status webhooks for the following events:

. *Online*: from any status, except utilizing, to *online*
. *Offline*: from any status to offline
. *Utilizing*: from any status to utilizing
. *Unplugged*: from any status to unplugged

[NOTE]
===============================
Device status webhooks are only available for *Private* and *Local* devices. They cannot be used to report status for *Public* devices.

== Execute a webhook

When a webhook is created, it tracks the status of the Private and Local devices in an org. It sends HTTP callbacks to the specified URL when a condition is met for those devices.

The body of the callback will be similar to the below:

[source,JavaScript]
----
{
  "creationTime": "2023-01-06T04:52:36.963Z",
  "eventType": "DEVICE",
  "eventActivity": "device.state.utilizing",
  "eventDescription": "Utilizing",
  "deviceUdid": "ce0917198075440c057e",
  "deviceName": "Galaxy Note 8",
  "orgId": 2,
  "webhookId": 129,
  "webhookName": "Webhook for All events"
}
----

See below for details of the parameters in the example above:


[options="header"]
|=======================
|Parameter|Description
|creationTime|The date and time the callback is sent
|eventType|The type of event
|eventActivity|The triggering event

For offline and online events, it appears with the format: device.status.<event>

For unplugged and utilizing events, it appears with the format: device.state.<event>
|eventDescription|The description of the webhook triggering event
|deviceUdid|The UDID of the device
|deviceName|The name of the device
|orgId|The unique ID of the organization
|webhookId|The unique ID of the webhook
|webhookName|The webhook name
|=======================

== Delete a webhook

If you no longer want to receive a callback, delete the webhook.

Navigate to *Webhook Settings*, select a webhook, and choose *Delete*.

== Verify a webhook

To quickly verify a webhook created Kobiton, use an online webhook testing site such as link:https://webhook.site/[webhook.site] or build your own API to receive the webhook.

== Limitations

* Authentication to URLs for webhook callbacks is currently not supported.
* It is not possible to limit the scope of devices tracked by webhook to specific teams or device bundles.
