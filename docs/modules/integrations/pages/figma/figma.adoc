:navtitle: Enable Figma integration

Learn how to enable Figma so you can use the xref:session-explorer:session-explorer-tools/fix-ui-and-wireframe-inconsistences.adoc[session explorer] to flag inconsistencies between your app's Figma wireframe and final design.

[NOTE]
You can only connect to one Figma file at a time. If you want to connect to a different file, you'll need to remove the current file from and xref:_connect_to_a_figma_file[connect to the new one].
