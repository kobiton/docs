:navtitle: Enable Jira Data Center integration

Learn how to integrate with Jira Data Center so your users can create Jira tickets right from the xref:session-explorer:manage-sessions.adoc#_create_a_jira_ticket[Session Explorer].

== Before you start

* Set up a Jira Data Center instance in the cloud or on-premise.
* For Cloud and Hybrid customers, ensure that the Jira Data Center can connect to the Kobiton portal. The most straightforward way is to host Jira Data Center on a public server. If this is not an option, additional instructions will come soon.
* For Standalone/On-prem customers, instructions to connect to Jira Data Center will come soon.
* An admin account on Jira Data Center and an account with ADMIN predefined role in Kobiton are required.
* Your Kobiton subscription must include Jira integration.
