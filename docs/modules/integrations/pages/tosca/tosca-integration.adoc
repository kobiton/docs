= User Guide: Mobile Test Automation with Tosca

This guide explains how to create and execute a mobile test in Tosca, from project setup to test execution on a device.

== 1. Create a new Tosca project

. Open *Tosca Commander*.
. Select *Project > New*.
. In the *Create New Project* dialog box, enter a name for your project.
. Select a storage type (e.g., *File-based*, *Common Repository*).
. Choose a location or database connection.
. Select *Create*.

[NOTE]
====
✅ *Tip:* Always use a meaningful project name to help with future organization and version control.
====

== 2. Connect to a mobile device and scan mobile objects

. In *Tosca Commander*, go to the *Modules* tab.
. Select *Scan > Mobile*.
. Choose a connected device from the list.
+
If no device is shown, ensure your device is connected and the *Tosca Mobile Agent* is running.
. Select the mobile application to test.
. Navigate through the app on the device.
. Click *Scan* to capture objects from the app screen.
. Confirm the scanned objects, then select *Finish*.

[NOTE]
====
🔎 *Note:* Scanned objects will appear under the *Modules* folder.
====

== 3. Create a new test case with scanned objects

. Go to the *TestCases* tab.
. Right-click the folder where you want to store the test case.
. Select *Create TestCase*.
. Drag and drop scanned Modules (objects) into the test case.
. Configure test steps by editing values, actions, or input parameters as needed.

[NOTE]
====
💡 *Best practice:* Name test steps clearly (e.g., "Tap Login Button", "Enter Username") for easy identification.
====

== 4. Execute the test case on a device

. Select the created test case.
. Right-click and choose *Run in ScratchBook* or use *Run > ScratchBook* on the toolbar.
. Choose a device in the execution configuration.
. Start execution.

[NOTE]
====
🛠 *Troubleshooting:* If the device is not available, verify connectivity and that the Tosca Mobile Agent is running.

. Right-click an ExecutionList or create a new one by selecting *Create ExecutionList*.
. Right-click the list and choose *Add TestCase*.
. Select the test case created earlier.

[NOTE]
====
📁 *Tip:* You can add multiple test cases to a single ExecutionList to organize related scenarios.
