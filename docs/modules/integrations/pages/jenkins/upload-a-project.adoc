:navtitle: Upload a project

Learn how to upload your project files to a cloud repository (like link:https://github.com/about[GitHub] or link:https://about.gitlab.com/[GitLab]), so you can integrate Jenkins into your test automation pipeline.

[NOTE]
If your project is already hosted in a cloud repository, skip to xref:integrations:jenkins/create-a-build.adoc[].

== Before you start

You'll need to complete the following:

* Create xref:automation-testing:scripting/auto-generate-an-appium-script.adoc[or generate] a test script with xref:automation-testing:capabilities/auto-generate-capabilities.adoc[Kobiton capabilities].
* Verify SSH has been set up on your cloud repository account.
