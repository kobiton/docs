== Execute automation test using Kobiton devices

This step will execute an automated test script on the Kobiton service (see link:https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/kobiton-execute-test[Integrations]).

You can search for this step in the Workflow editor:

To use this step, you will need the following information:

==== A- Kobiton API Credentials

To get your Kobiton Username and API Key, login to the Kobiton portal and go to link:https://portal.kobiton.com/settings/keys[link:https://portal.kobiton.com/settings/keys]

==== B- Kobiton Executor Server Credentials
We will provide you with credentials to access our TestNG Execution Server. This will be used to execute your automation test script. Fill in your information in these fields:

* Executor Server URL
* Kobiton Executor Username
* Kobiton Executor Password

==== C- Git repository contains your TestNG automation test script + SSH Key

In order to execute your TestNG automation test script, we need to access your Git repository.

For your security, we highly recommend setting your Git repository to Private and prepare an SSH key for it.

If you do not know how to authenticate the key with Git, please follow the guide from link:https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent[Github create SSH key instruction] and link:https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account[Github adding the key to account instruction].

Fill your Git repository info to these fields on the Bitrise Step:

* Git Repository URL
* SSH Key for Git Repository

==== D- Execution Inputs
* Root Directory: Root directory where the execution should start
* Commands: List of commands that you want to execute
* Wait for Execution: Wait for the execution to finish
* Log type: Set the log type

==== E- Use a custom device to execute your script

If you haven't set the device information in your script, use this section to choose a device to execute your test script. Set “Use Custom Device” to True and input below info:

* Kobiton Cloud Device Name

* Device Platform version

* Device Platform (android/iOS)

Please ignore this part if you already set above information in your desiredCapabilities.

Once you're done inputting all above info (from A to D/E) for the step - save the workflow then start/schedule your build in Bitrise.
