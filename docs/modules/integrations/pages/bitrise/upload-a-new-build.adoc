== Upload new build of application to Kobiton App repo

This Step will take your latest build and upload it to the Kobiton App Repo (it will either create a new app or upload a new version of the existing app).

This step is already launched and available in the Bitrise Step library (see link:https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/kobiton-app-upload[Integrations]).

To use it, go to link:https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/steps-and-workflows/adding-steps-to-a-workflow.html#adding-steps-to-a-workflow[Workflow editor], click *+* and search for Kobiton:

Review and input your app info as well as your Kobiton credentials (to get your Kobiton Username and API Key, login to the Kobiton portal and go to link:https://portal.kobiton.com/settings/keys[link:https://portal.kobiton.com/settings/keys]).

Some additional notes:

* Input "App ID" if you want to upload a new version for an existing app.
* You can choose the App Privacy setting: Public (available for all member users in an organization to access) or Private (only available for you to access).

Once you're done inputting variables for the step, save the workflow, then start/schedule your build in Bitrise.
