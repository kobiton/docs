:navtitle: Run an automation test

Learn how to run an automation test using BuildKite.

== Before you start

You'll need to complete the following:

* link:https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/create-your-own[Create a BuildKite pipeline].
* xref:integrations:upload-a-project-to-your-cloud-vcs.adoc[Upload a project to your cloud VCS].

== Get your credentials

Some credentials can be added while you're xref:_modify_your_pipeline_yml_file[modifying your `pipeline.yml` file], but others are easier to get beforehand. Save these credentials to a secure location so you can easily add them to your `pipeline.yml` later:

* *Kobiton API key:* get API key values from your list of xref:profile:manage-your-api-credentials.adoc[Kobiton API keys].
* *Executor server credentials:* N/A
* *Cloud repository credentials:* get the URL and SSH key for the xref:integrations:upload-a-project-to-your-cloud-vcs.adoc[project you uploaded].
