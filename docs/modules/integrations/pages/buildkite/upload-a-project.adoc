:navtitle: Upload a project

Learn how to upload your project files to a cloud repository (like link:https://github.com/about[GitHub] or link:https://about.gitlab.com/[GitLab]), so you can integrate BuildKite into your test automation pipeline.

[NOTE]
If your project is already hosted in a cloud repository, skip to xref:integrations:buildkite/run-an-automation-test.adoc[].

== Before you start

You'll need to set up SSH for your cloud repository account.
