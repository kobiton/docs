Add your IdP parameters and certificate to the following:

* *Identity provider issuer*
* *Identity issuer URL*
* *Identity provider sign in URL*
* *Identity provider sign out URL*
* *Identity provider certificate*

+

[IMPORTANT]
The Identity provider certificate must be a `.pem` file. If the certificate downloaded from the IdP has a different file extension (such as `.cert`), rename it to `.pem` before uploading.
