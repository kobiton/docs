After being assigned as the default for the team, the cleanup policy is applied at the end of all sessions launched under the team.

In the xref:devices:local-devices/cleanup-policy/manage-device-cleanup-policies.adoc#_open_the_cleanup_policies_page[Cleanup Policies page,window=read-later], you can view all teams assigned to the cleanup policy by selecting *View teams*.
