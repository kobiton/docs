:navtitle: User roles

This section walks users through the introduction of Team Role, how to assign users and modify permissions.

The Team Role determines the access rights and privileges that members of the team have when interacting with Kobiton's system. There are three levels of Team Role:

* Team Owner: the one who created a team or assigned by the Org Owner as the Team Owner.
* Team Admin.
* Team Member.

[NOTE]
====
* Available accounts belong to at least a Team and a role.
* When a new user is added to a Team, they are automatically assigned as a Team Member.
* Team Admin can only access the Team they are assigned to, while The RBAC Admin [a][b] can access all teams in the organization.
