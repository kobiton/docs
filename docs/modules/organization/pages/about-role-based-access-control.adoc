== What is Role-Based Access Control?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an organizational structure and methodology that gives you more fine-tuned, granular control over your teams' work and what they can work with. With RBAC you can make custom rules for your organization that enable you to define which devices and/or actions your users have access to.

== How it works in Kobiton

In Kobiton, RBAC consists of xref:_roles[roles], xref:_users[users], and xref:_teams[teams]:

[#_roles]
=== Roles

**Roles** are one or more xref:organization:roles/user-roles-and-permissions.adoc[user permissions] grouped together, allowing to assign custom roles to users and teams and avoid assigning the same frequently-used permissions to every new user or team.

[#_users]
=== Users

**Users** are assigned a role and a team, which impacts their xref:organization:users/user-roles-and-permissions.adoc[user permissions] across Kobiton.

[#_teams]
=== Teams

**Teams** are a group of two or more users with shared xref:organization:teams/team-roles-and-permissions.adoc[team permissions], allowing you to assign and manage permissions to the whole group at once.
