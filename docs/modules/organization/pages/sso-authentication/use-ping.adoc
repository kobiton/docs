= Use Ping Identity for SSO authentication
:navtitle: Use Ping Identity

This guide will walk you through connecting link:https://www.pingidentity.com/[Ping Identity,window=read-later] to Kobiton using SAML 2.0. After completing these steps, users in your organization will be able to log in to Kobiton using their Ping Identity credentials.

== What Youâ€™ll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* An administrator account in both Kobiton and Ping Identity.
* An active environment in Ping Identity.

== Create a Ping Identity SSO Application

Log in to your Ping Identity admin account.

From the dashboard, choose the default *Administrators* environment or select another if needed.

Go to *Applications*, then select the plus icon to add a new app.

On the setup screen, enter a name for your application, such as `Kobiton SSO`, and choose *SAML Application* as the application type.

Select *Configure*, then select *Manually Enter* on the configuration page.

Paste the following from your Kobiton settings:

* *Reply (or SSO, or ACS) URL* into the *Reply URL* field
* *Entity ID (or Audience URL)* into the *Entity ID* field

Save your changes and continue.

By default, the application is not enabled. You need to manually enable it.

Open your newly created application and navigate to the *Attribute Mappings* tab.

Select the *edit icon* and add the following mappings:

[options="header"]
|===
| Kobiton Attribute | PingOne Attribute
| saml_subject      | User ID (default)
| email             | Email Address
| firstName         | Given Name
| lastName          | Family Name
| phoneNumber       | Mobile Phone
| memberOf          | Group Names
|===

Rename the downloaded file to `cert.pem`.

== Create a User and Group in Ping Identity

Create a new user in Ping Identity with the same email address as your Kobiton admin account.

Then create a group and assign this user to the group.

Return to the Ping SSO application, go to the *Access* tab, and click *Edit*.

Under *Groups*, select the group you just created and save your changes.
