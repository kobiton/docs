Another example of triggering Scriptless with some (but not all) devices in a
device bundle:

NOTE: If there are two devices specified in one *deviceCapabilities*
parameter, it would be an OR condition which means the system can pick either
*Galaxy Note10* or *Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G* if the other
device is not available.

There are more parameters that you can apply when triggering Scriptless rerun
sessions - see our
link:https://api.kobiton.com/docs/#start-scriptless-automation[API documentation]
for more information.

=== Trigger the API call

Select *Send* in Postman to trigger Kobiton Scriptless
reruns. The response would look like this:
