= Create a baseline session

== Overview

A baseline session is a manual test session that serves as the source for automated test execution. It captures how an application is exercised on a real device and provides the reference used to create a test case.

Baseline sessions are created through manual interaction in the Kobiton platform and are required before a test can be run automatically.

== What a baseline session is

A baseline session is a manual session performed on a real device through the platform.

During the session, a user interacts with the application as they would during normal testing. These interactions are recorded by the platform and later reused to define a test flow.

Once converted into a test case, the baseline session becomes the reference for future test execution.

== Create a baseline session

Baseline sessions are created by running a manual test session with capture enabled and completing a defined test flow.

=== 1. Start a manual session and enable capture

From the Devices view in the Kobiton platform, select a device and launch a manual session.

Before interacting with the application, select the *Play* button to enable session capturing mode.

Session capturing mode improves the accuracy of element detection by capturing precise element bounding boxes. Actions performed while capturing is enabled provide the most reliable results for scriptless execution.

If your test requires an application, install or select the app at the start of the session.

NOTE: Actions performed before capture is enabled are still recorded, but may result in reduced element accuracy during automated execution.

=== 2. Perform the test flow

Interact with the application as you would during normal testing.

While capture is enabled, the platform records supported interactions and associates them with the current application state. These recorded interactions form the basis of the baseline session.

Focus on completing a single, intentional test flow from start to finish.

=== 3. End the session and convert it to a test case

When the test flow is complete, exit the manual session by selecting the *X* icon.

After the session ends, it appears in Session Explorer. From Session Explorer, the session can be converted into a test case. Once converted, the test case is managed through Test Management, where it can be reviewed, edited, and used to create test runs.

== What makes a good baseline

Baseline sessions are most reliable when they reflect a clear and stable test flow.

Good baseline sessions typically:

* Follow a single, intentional path through the application
* Use supported interactions only
* Avoid unnecessary navigation or exploratory actions

Baseline quality directly affects how reliably a test can be executed later.

== Platform considerations

Baseline sessions are platform-specific.

Separate baseline sessions are required for Android and iOS, even when the application behavior is similar.

Baseline sessions must target a supported application context: a web application (Safari or Chrome), an app installed from the App Repository, or an existing app already available on the device.

Manual sessions can be converted into test cases even if unsupported actions were recorded. Test cases that contain unsupported actions cannot be executed in a test run until those steps are removed and the test case is saved as a new version.
