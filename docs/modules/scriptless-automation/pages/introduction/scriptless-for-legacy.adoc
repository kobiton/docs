NOTE: Currently, Scriptless Automation could be triggered on any Kobiton Android devices but we recommend to run with the option “Top 10 Global” for the best stability. In case you don’t receive the pop-up for selecting the device bundles, you might have violated some limitations of Scriptless Automation (unsupported test actions, some corner cases that Scriptless Automation does not supported yet, etc.). We are sorry for this inconvenience, you will need to perform a manual session again.
