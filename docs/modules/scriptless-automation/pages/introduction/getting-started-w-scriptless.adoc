+
5. See the Scriptless Automation’s result
+
Behind the scenes, Kobiton will do preparation for the process of running a massive number of devices. The process will take around an hour before generating a list of automated sessions from Scriptless Automation. After that, you will receive an announcement email for informing the successfully starting process.
+
* In the Session List, click on an automated session start with the Appium icon.
+

* In the Session Overview window, select the Nova icon on the upper right corner
+

+
** In the Test Run (Test Execution) window:
+
You will see there are test steps with purple, which mean those are the qualified test case for Scriptless Automation. Other steps will be considered as normal test steps within a manual session and will not be executed for Scriptless Automation.
+

The “borderline” between qualified Scriptless Automation test steps and nonqualified is the ‘Scriptless Automation Interrupted’, the reason might be some unexpected errors occurred like device and network issues or you might have violated some current Scriptless Automation unsupported actions.
+
Don’t worry! Your qualified test steps will be executed properly for Scriptless Automation. In case, you want to have a test case more properly, you can perform another test or you can send the *sessionID* for us to troubleshoot at: support@kobiton.com.
+
** Execution List
+
The execution list helps you manage and keep track of automated session. You can access the Execution list underneath the Test Case section in the Test Run (Test Execution) window.
