|Comparison Level |Scriptless Automation provides you an option to test the UI in 4 different comparison levels:

*Exact:* Compare and do not allow any difference (pixel-to-pixel comparison)

*Strict:* Compare and allow minor differences (up to the equivalent of 5% difference)

*Relaxed:* Compare and allow significant differences (up to the equivalent of 20% difference)

*Ignored:* Take the best matching element regardless there are similarities

|Scope |Scriptless Automation provides you an option to select the scope to apply the "new baselines on":

*Manufacture*

*Aspect ratio*

*Device model*

|Noticed |For any remediations that could not be remediated (Application crashed, missing element, etc.), you can use this button to mark an execution as failed, and it will be excluded for the next re-run.

_Note: In the future, we will implement the Create Defect to allow report bug instantly on our platform_

|Submit |After you click the "Submit" button, the remediation will be applied right away, and the given execution will be automatically run again.

* You can access back your submitted remediation
