= Ignore a remediation
:navtitle: Ignore a remediation

When you encounter a non-annotated remediation and sure that this is an issue from the application and it is required to fix for the next release, then you use the ignore to exclude an execution out from the Scriptless Automation process. Therefore, you will not encounter the remediation again.
