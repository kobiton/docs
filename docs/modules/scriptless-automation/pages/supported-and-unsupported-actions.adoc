The following actions *may* impact Scriptless Automation performance

* Clicking very quickly. For best results,
*please wait three seconds* between two manual actions. This
wait will ensure the screen has loaded completely when you make another “click”
action.
* Swiping on map
* Clicking outside the pop-up to close it. Instead -  use "Back" button
in the manual toolbar to close the pop-up
* Tapping on text prediction above the virtual keyboard
* Typing text into number input only
* Typing string that has length more than limit when editing text
