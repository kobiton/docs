= Run a Scriptless test

== Overview

Running a Scriptless test applies an existing test definition to one or more devices. Tests are executed automatically based on interactions previously recorded during a manual session.

In the Kobiton platform, Scriptless tests are run through Test Management. Execution results are captured for review and can be rerun as needed.

== Before you begin

Before running a test, ensure the following:

* A test case has been created from a baseline session
* The application under test is available in a supported application context (native app, web application, or preinstalled app)
* At least one compatible device is available

== Run a test in the platform

Tests are run from Test Management in the Kobiton platform.

From Test Management, users can create a test run using a single test case or a test suite. During setup, the test definition, application version, and target devices are selected.

Once a test run starts, the platform executes the recorded interactions automatically on the selected devices. Test execution does not require user interaction while the run is in progress.

== What happens during execution

During execution, the platform replays the recorded interactions step by step on each device.

For each step, the system attempts to match the recorded interaction to the current application state. Execution continues until all steps are completed or until user action is required.

Execution progress and status are visible while the test is running.

== Review test results

After execution completes, results are available in Test Management.

Each test run includes:

* Overall execution status
* Device-level execution details
* Validation results, such as Crash, Accessibility, and Response Time findings

If execution cannot proceed for a particular step, the test run is marked as requiring action and must be remediated before execution can continue.

== Rerun a test

Test runs can be rerun using the same configuration.

Reruns repeat the original execution using the same test definition and device selection. This is commonly used after issues are addressed or when validating execution behavior.

== Advanced usage

Tests can also be triggered programmatically using the Kobiton API. This approach is typically used for automated pipelines or advanced workflows.
