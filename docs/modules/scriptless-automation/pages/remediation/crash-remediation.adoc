:navtitle: Crash remediation

When a crash happens on any executions, Scriptless Automation will automatically detect and bring-out the specific crash log within the remediation. In this case, Scriptless Automation provides you with new remediation actions such as Ignore or Report Bug.

In this case a crash happened when revisited on Samsung S9, Scriptless Automation will immediately capture and raise a remediation with the specific crash log attached along with the device information like the OS, OS version, resolution, etc. for both devices to help testers have more insights for investigating the issue.
