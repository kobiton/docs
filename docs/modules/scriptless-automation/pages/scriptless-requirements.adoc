If an unsupported action is performed, the Scriptless Automation stops capturing, and subsequent steps after the unsupported action are not captured and executable in rerun/revisit or in the auto-generated scripts.

In the Session Explorer, the unsupported actions are highlighted in red:

In the Automated Test Case, only test steps before the unsupported action are included:

== Application requirements

The following requirements pertain to the application(s) installed and/or opened in the manual or automation session:

* Must not contain dynamic content. Examples: news apps, games, etc.

* Must not contain CAPTCHA verification flow.

* Must enable `.setWebContentDebuggingEnable` for Android apps. If this configuration is disabled, Kobiton cannot access the HTML source of the application. Visit https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/webviews/#configure_webviews_for_debugging[this link] for more information.
