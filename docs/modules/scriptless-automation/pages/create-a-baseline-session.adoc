:navtitle: Create a baseline session

Learn how to create a baseline session for scriptless automation. After you create a baseline session, you can use the xref:run-scriptless-automation/using-the-kobiton-portal.adoc[Kobiton portal] or xref:run-scriptless-automation/using-the-kobiton-api.adoc[Kobiton API] to rerun your test steps on the same device or on completely different devices--_without_ writing any test scripts.

You can upload a xref:apps:supported-filetypes.adoc[supported filetype] from your computer, install an app from a URL, or choose an app from xref:apps:manage-apps.adoc[your app repository]. If you plan on testing your in-app camera, be sure to enable *Instrument application for camera injection* before you install.
