|The manual session that you just performed the test The system will base it on the defined groupID to generate the automation test sessions.

_Note: In this case, users performed manual test on the device: Xperia XZ Premium - Android 8.0.0_

|
|With manual sessions that triggered Scriptless Automation, there are always 2 new icons displayed within a session’s row

From left to right:

1.1: Re-run Scriptless Automation

1.2: Execution List

|1.1
|You can trigger the process of running on multiple devices to run again

_Note: Right now Scriptless Automation allows you to run on the same devices that you have been selected. In the future, Scriptless Automation will give you another ability to re-run on other sets of devices._

|1.2
|The execution is just another place where you can manage and keep track of all automated sessions’ status.

You can find more information about the Execution List in the next section 5.2 below

|2
|	The list of automated sessions that Kobiton automatically revisited on other multiple devices based on the manual session at #1

_Note: In this case, users select the bundle of 20 global devices_
|===
+
NOTE: Sometimes you will see the error icon within the manual session’s row, which means there are some problems with the process of generating automated sessions. For this situation, you can either use the re-run icon or you can directly contact us for support at: support@kobiton.com.
+
** In the Session Details:
+
By the time, in the session details of the manual session triggered Scriptless Automation, you will see there are test steps with purple, which mean those are the qualified test case for Scriptless Automation. Other steps will be considered as normal test steps within a manual session and will not be executed for Scriptless Automation.
+
The “borderline” between qualified Scriptless Automation test steps and nonqualified is the ‘Scriptless Automation Interrupted’, the reason might be some unexpected errors occurred like device and network issues or you might have violated some current Scriptless Automation unsupported actions.
+
Don’t worry! Your qualified test steps will be executed properly for Scriptless Automation. In case, you want to have a test case more properly, you can perform another test or you can send the *sessionID* for us to troubleshoot at: support@kobiton.com.
+
