== How to bypass OTP

*Step 1:* During a Manual Test session with Kobiton, after installing an iOS or Android app that requires One Time Password (OTP) authentication, you can input your phone number and your received passcode as common flow.

*Step 2:* When exiting the session, you may encounter Scriptless Automation popup and jump to Text Execution Plan for setting up some pre-condition before triggering Scriptless Automation.

*Step 3:* Finally, click on the run Scriptless Sessions button to trigger automation test sessions on multiple device types. Let us bypass OTP authentication in the automation sessions under our background.

NOTE: In the Text Execution Plan, please focus on the Dynamic Data section, you can override your dataset related to phone number and OTP instead of using our bypassing OTP in the background. For your reference on how to set dynamic data, please access the guideline below.
