:navtitle: Add the image injection SDK to your iOS app

Learn how to implement Kobitonâ€™s custom SDK in your iOS application to enable Image Injection.

== Prerequisites

* A project in Xcode 14.0 or later that targets iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later devices.
* The project uses xref:image-injection-sdk/supported-methods.adoc#_iosipados_methods[supported camera methods].
* Download the https://kobiton.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/KobitonSDK-ios.zip[SDK]. The downloaded file's name should be `KobitonSDK-ios.zip`.

== Integrate the SDK

Extract `KobitonSDK-ios.zip` into the `KobitonSdk.framework` folder.

Open your Xcode project.

Drag and drop the `KobitonSdk.framework` folder into any location in your project folder.

In the popup, check the box *Copy items if needed*. Select the appropriate targets that you want to include the SDK in, then choose *Finish*.

== Build and Upload

Build and export your project as an `.ipa` file.

Upload the `.ipa` file to the xref:apps:upload-an-app/using-the-kobiton-portal.adoc[app repository] or to the cloud and xref:manual-testing:install-an-app.adoc[install the app] on a Kobiton device, then follow the guides to use image injection in a xref:manual-testing:test-your-app-camera.adoc[manual session] or an xref:automation-testing:scripting/create-image-injection-script.adoc[automation session].
