* Image injection via app instrumentation is only available for Android apps.

* Images cannot be injected into some Android applications due to the immense number of required libraries, we currently support the most common libraries. If you encounter issues, please contact our Support team through support@kobiton.com.

* Inject the image after launching the camera. Injecting the image before launching the camera might crash the app.

* It may take up to 5 seconds for the image injection process to complete.

* The injected image is zoomed a little when in use, compared to the actual size.
