= Upload an app using the Kobiton API (Postman)
:navtitle: Using the Kobiton API (Postman)

Learn how to use Postman to upload an app to the xref:manage-apps.adoc[app repository] using our link:https://api.kobiton.com/v2/docs/[REST API].

== Before you start

* Make sure your app package belongs to a xref:apps:supported-filetypes.adoc[supported filetype and size].
* xref:profile:manage-your-api-credentials.adoc[Get your API credentials].
* Familiarity with using Postman to link:https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/[send API request] is required.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Throughtout this document, replace `\https://api.kobiton.com` with `[http/https]://[Dell server IP or hostname]:3000` if you are using Standalone server.
====

[#_configure_authorization_in_postman]
== Configure authorization in Postman

Most of the Kobiton API v2 endpoints requires link:https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/#basic-auth[Basic Authentication].

For the requests that require authorization in this document, do the following under the *Authorization* tab:

* Choose *Basic Auth* as *Type*.
* Input the username and API key from xref:profile:manage-your-api-credentials.adoc[your Kobiton API credentials]. It is recommended to input this information as link:https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables[variable] to protect sensitive data.

[#_generate_an_upload_url]
== Generate an upload URL

In Postman, create a new request with the `POST` method. This request requires authorization.

For `URL`, input `\https://api.kobiton.com/v2/apps/upload-url`.

Under the *Body* tab, select *raw*, then choose the *JSON* format and input the following details:

[source]
----
{
    "file_name": "${app_file_name}",
    "app_id": ${app_id}
}
----

The request body has 2 parameters:

* `+${app_id}+`: (optional) Provide the `app_id` if another version of this app is already uploaded. _Example_: `100`.
* `+${app_file_name}+`: (required) Name of the app file to upload. _Example_: `MyApp.ipa`.

[TIP]
====
You can look up the `app_id` in xref:apps:app-metadata.adoc#_app_id[app metadata].
====

We will use the app `MyApp.ipa` throughout this guide to demonstrate the upload process. Assuming this app does not exist in the repository, there is no need to specify an `app_id` in the request body:

[source]
----
{
    "file_name": "MyApp.ipa"
}
----

Below is an example of how the request would look like in Postman:

image:apps:generate-upload-url-postman.png[width=1000,alt="Generate an upload URL request body"]

Click *Send* to send the request. A successful response will return the following:

.Example
[source,shell]
----
{
    "app_path": "users/1/apps/MyApp‐237824a0‐302c‐9bfd‐ff417c89610a.ipa",
    "url": "https://kobiton-us-west.s3.amazonaws.com/users/78042/apps/MyApp-57b15160-cf17-11ee-98d5-e949a34321c7f.ipa?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYOIAYUIRGDSFS6QO&Content-Type=application%2Foctet-stream&Expires=1708384165&Signature=VHTRqXdIpKmbvauPsdfsKJhAgk%3D&x-amz-acl=private&x-amz-meta-appid=600841&x-amz-meta-createdby=78042&x-amz-meta-organizationid=681&x-amz-tagging=unsaved%3Dtrue"
}
----

Save the above values for the next sections.

== Upload app file to S3 storage

Create a new request with `PUT` method.

For `URL`, input the `url` from the response from the previous section. Following the example, the `url` would be:

[source]
https://kobiton-us-west.s3.amazonaws.com/users/78042/apps/MyApp-57b15160-cf17-11ee-98d5-e949a34321c7f.ipa?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYOIAYUIRGDSFS6QO&Content-Type=application%2Foctet-stream&Expires=1708384165&Signature=VHTRqXdIpKmbvauPsdfsKJhAgk%3D&x-amz-acl=private&x-amz-meta-appid=600841&x-amz-meta-createdby=78042&x-amz-meta-organizationid=681&x-amz-tagging=unsaved%3Dtrue

Under the *Authorization* tab, select *No Auth* for Type, since this endpoint does not require any authorization.

image:apps:no-auth-postman.png[width=1000,alt="Set authorization type as No Auth"]

Under the *Header* tab, add the following key and value pairs:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Key    |Value
|x-amz-tagging  |unsaved=true
|Content-Type   |application/octet-stream
|=======================

image:apps:header-key-value-pairs.png[width=1000,alt="Add header key and value pairs"]

Under the *Body* tab, select *binary*, then *Select file*. Choose the app package file you want to upload.

image:apps:binary-file-upload-postman.png[width=1000,alt="Select binary file to upload in the request body"]

Click *Send*. A blank response and `Status: 200 OK` indicates a successful upload.

[#_create_app_or_app_version]
== Create the app or app version in the app repository

In Postman, create a new request with `POST` method. This request requires authorization.

For `URL`, input `\https://api.kobiton.com/v2/apps`.

[IMPORTANT]
In the *Header* tab, remove the `x-amz-tagging` and `Content-Type` from the previous request (Upload app file to S3 storage) if they exist.

Under the *Body* tab, select *raw*, then choose the *JSON* format and input the following details:

[source]
----
{
    "file_name": "${app_file_name}",
    "app_path": "${app_path}"
}
----

The request body contains 2 parameters:

* `+${app_path}+`: (required) Use the value of `app_path` from the xref:_generate_an_upload_url[previous step].
* `+${app_file_name}+`: (optional) Specify the name of the app. If not provided, the name of the file from `+${app_path}+` is used.

Continuing on from the previous steps, the request body would be:

[source,shell]
----
{
    "file_name": "MyApp.ipa",
    "app_path": "users/1/apps/MyApp‐237824a0‐302c‐9bfd‐ff417c89610a.ipa"
}
----

Below is an example of how the request would look like in Postman:

image:apps:create-app-or-app-verison-postman.png[width=1000,alt="Request body of the create app or app version api"]

Click *Send*. If your request was successful, `POST` will return a `200` status with the following response:

[source,shell]
----
{
  "app_id": 100,
  "version_id": 101
}
----

In the response above, `app_id` is the ID of the new app, and `version_id` is the ID of the new application version.

If the app file is too large, it may take a while to process the file and the value of `app_id` will be `N/A`. See the next section on how to obtain the `app_id`.

== Obtain the app ID

In Postman, create a new request with `GET` method. This request requires authorization.

For `URL`, input `\https://api.kobiton.com/v2/apps/parsing-status?appVersionId=${version_id}`.

Provide in the `URL` above the `version_id` obtained from the xref:_create_app_or_app_version[previous step]. Continuing on with the example, the `URL` would be:

[source]
https://api.kobiton.com/v2/apps/parsing-status?appVersionId=101

Below is an example of how the request would look like in Postman:

image:get-app-parsing-status-postman.png[width=1000,alt="Get app parsing status request body"]

Click *Send*. If your request was successful, `GET` will return a `200` status with the following response:

[source,shell]
----

{
"app_id": 100,
"state": "OK"
}

----


The response has 2 parameters:

* `state`: indicates the parsing status of the app.
** `OK`: The uploaded application is processed by the server and is ready to use.
** `PARSING`: The server is still processing the uploaded application.
** `FAILURE_PARSING`: The server could not process the uploaded application, typically due to an invalid file type.

* `app_id`: the ID of the app to use in other endpoints such as installing the app on a device or get information about a specific app.

[NOTE]
If you receive `error 404` with the message `App version ID ... doesn't exist`, the application version might be made inaccessible to your account. Contact an admin for access.

== Troubleshooting

=== _Create the app or app version_ request failed with status 400

* *Issue*: After sending the request to xref:_create_app_or_app_version[create the app or app version], the response code is `400` with message `The app_path is required.`

image:apps:error-400-create-app-or-app-version.png[width=1000,alt="Error 400 from sending create app or app version request"]

* *Cause*: The `x-amz-tagging` and `Content-Type` headers from the previous request (Upload app file to S3 storage) are not removed.

* *Solution*: In the *Header* tab of the request, remove `x-amz-tagging` and `Content-Type`, then send the request again.
