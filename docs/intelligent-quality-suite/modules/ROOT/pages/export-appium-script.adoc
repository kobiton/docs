= Export Appium Script

You can export an Appium script from any Kobiton session, manual or automation. You can then point the execution of that script to a local Appium Server, Kobiton's Appium Server, or even the Appium Server hosted by one of Kobiton's competitors: SauceLabs, BrowserStack, Perfecto, Digital.ai, and Headspin.

WARNING: Watch out!
